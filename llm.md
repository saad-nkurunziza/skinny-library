# What is Tauri?

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, fast binaries for all major desktop and mobile platforms. Developers can integrate any frontend framework that compiles to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for building their user experience while leveraging languages such as Rust, Swift, and Kotlin for backend logic when needed.

Get started building with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) by using one of the below commands. Be sure to follow the [prerequisites guide](/start/prerequisites/) to install all of the dependencies required by Tauri and then view the [Frontend Configuration guides](/start/frontend/) for recommended frontend configurations.

import Cta from '../_fragments/cta.mdx';

<Cta />

After you've created your first app you can explore the different features and recipes of Tauri in the [List of Features & Recipes](/plugin/).

## Why Tauri?

Tauri has 3 main advantages for developers to build upon:

- Secure foundation for building apps
- Smaller bundle size by using the system's native webview
- Flexibility for developers to use any frontend and bindings for multiple languages

Learn more about the Tauri philosophy in the [Tauri 1.0 blog post](/blog/tauri-1-0/).

### Secure Foundation

By being built on Rust, Tauri is able to take advantage of the memory, thread, and type-safety offered by Rust. Apps built on Tauri can automatically get those benefits even without needing to be developed by Rust experts.

Tauri also undergoes a security audit for major and minor releases. This not only covers code in the Tauri organization, but also for upstream dependencies that Tauri relies on. Of course this doesn't mitigate all risks, but it provides a solid foundation for developers to build on top of.

Read the [Tauri security policy](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/policy) and the [Tauri 2.0 audit report](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/audits/Radically_Open_Security-v2-report.pdf).

### Smaller App Size

Tauri apps take advantage of the web view already available on every user's system. A Tauri app only contains the code and assets specific for that app and doesn't need to bundle a browser engine with every app. This means that a minimal Tauri app can be less than 600KB in size.

Learn more about creating optimized apps in the [App Size concept](/concept/size/).

### Flexible Architecture

Since Tauri uses web technologies that means that virtually any frontend framework is compatible with Tauri. The [Frontend Configuration guide](/start/frontend/) contains common configurations for popular frontend frameworks.

Bindings between JavaScript and Rust are available to developers using the `invoke` function in JavaScript and Swift and Kotlin bindings are available for [Tauri Plugins](/develop/plugins/).

[TAO](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao) is responsible for Tauri window creation and [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) is responsible for web view rendering. These are libraries maintained by Tauri and can be consumed directly if deeper system integration is required outside of what Tauri exposes.

In addition, Tauri maintains a number of plugins to extend what core Tauri exposes. You can find those plugins alongside those provided by the community in the [Plugins section](/plugin/).

# Create a Project

import { Card, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import Cta from '@fragments/cta.mdx';

One thing that makes Tauri so flexible is its ability to work with virtually any frontend framework. We've created the [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) utility to help you create a new Tauri project using one of the officially maintained framework templates.

`create-tauri-app` currently includes templates for vanilla (HTML, CSS and JavaScript without a framework), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Yew](https://yew.rs/), [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos), and [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/). You can also find or add your own community templates and frameworks in the [Awesome Tauri repo](https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri).

{/* TODO: redirect to integrate to existing front-end project specific docs */}
Alternatively, you can [add Tauri to an existing project](#manual-setup-tauri-cli) to quickly turn your existing codebase into a Tauri app.

## Using `create-tauri-app`

To get started using `create-tauri-app` run one of the below commands in the folder you'd like to setup your project. If you're not sure which command to use we recommend the Bash command on Linux and macOS and the PowerShell command on Windows.

<Cta />

Follow along with the prompts to choose your project name, frontend language, package manager, and frontend framework, and frontend framework options if applicable.

:::tip[Not sure what to choose?]

We recommend starting with the vanilla template (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework) to get started. You can always [integrate a frontend framework](/start/frontend/) later.

- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `TypeScript / JavaScript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `TypeScript`

:::

#### Scaffold a new project

<Steps>

1. Choose a name and a bundle identifier (unique-id for your app):
   ```
   ? Project name (tauri-app) ›
   ? Identifier (com.tauri-app.app) ›
   ```
2. Select a flavor for your frontend. First the language:
   ```
   ? Choose which language to use for your frontend ›
   Rust  (cargo)
   TypeScript / JavaScript  (pnpm, yarn, npm, bun)
   .NET  (dotnet)
   ```
3. Select a package manager (if there are multiple available):

   Options for **TypeScript / JavaScript**:

   ```
   ? Choose your package manager ›
   pnpm
   yarn
   npm
   bun
   ```

4. Select a UI Template and flavor (if there are multiple available):

   Options for **Rust**:

   ```
   ? Choose your UI template ›
   Vanilla
   Yew
   Leptos
   Sycamore
   ```

   Options for **TypeScript / JavaScript**:

   ```
   ? Choose your UI template ›
   Vanilla
   Vue
   Svelte
   React
   Solid
   Angular
   Preact

   ? Choose your UI flavor ›
   TypeScript
   JavaScript
   ```

   Options for **.NET**:

   ```
   ? Choose your UI template ›
   Blazor  (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor/)
   ```

</Steps>

Once completed, the utility reports that the template has been created and displays how to run it using the configured package manager. If it detects missing dependencies on your system, it prints a list of packages and prompts how to install them.

{/* TODO: Can CTA offer to install the deps? */}

#### Start the development server

After `create-tauri-app` has completed, you can navigate into your project's folder, install dependencies, and then use the [Tauri CLI](/reference/cli/) to start the development server:

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

<CommandTabs
  npm="cd tauri-app
    npm install
    npm run tauri dev"
  yarn="cd tauri-app
    yarn install
    yarn tauri dev"
  pnpm="cd tauri-app
    pnpm install
    pnpm tauri dev"
  deno="cd tauri-app
    deno install
    deno task tauri dev"
  bun="cd tauri-app
    bun install
    bun tauri dev
  "
  cargo="cd tauri-app
    cargo tauri dev"
/>

You'll now see a new window open with your app running.

**Congratulations!** You've made your Tauri app! 🚀

## Manual Setup (Tauri CLI)

If you already have an existing frontend or prefer to set it up yourself, you can use the Tauri CLI to initialize the backend for your project separately.

:::note
The following example assumes you are creating a new project. If you've already initialized the frontend of your application, you can skip the first step.
:::

<Steps>

    1. Create a new directory for your project and initialize the frontend. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or any framework you prefer such as Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Yew, or Leptos. You just need a way of serving the app in your browser. Just as an example, this is how you would setup a simple Vite app:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                npm create vite@latest ."
            yarn="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                yarn create vite ."
            pnpm="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                pnpm create vite ."
            deno="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                deno run -A npm:create-vite ."
            bun="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                bun create vite"
        />

    2. Then, install Tauri's CLI tool using your package manager of choice. If you are using `cargo` to install the Tauri CLI, you will have to install it globally.

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npm install -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            yarn="yarn add -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            pnpm="pnpm add -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            deno="deno add -D npm:@tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            bun="bun add -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            cargo='cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0" --locked'
        />

    3. Determine the URL of your frontend development server. This is the URL that Tauri will use to load your content. For example, if you are using Vite, the default URL is `http://localhost:5173`.

    4. In your project directory, initialize Tauri:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npx tauri init"
            yarn="yarn tauri init"
            pnpm="pnpm tauri init"
            deno="deno task tauri init"
            bun="bun tauri init"
            cargo="cargo tauri init"
        />

        After running the command it will display a prompt asking you for different options:

        ```sh frame=none
        ✔ What is your app name? tauri-app
        ✔ What should the window title be? tauri-app
        ✔ Where are your web assets located? ..
        ✔ What is the url of your dev server? http://localhost:5173
        ✔ What is your frontend dev command? pnpm run dev
        ✔ What is your frontend build command? pnpm run build
        ```

        This will create a `src-tauri` directory in your project with the necessary Tauri configuration files.

    5. Verify your Tauri app is working by running the development server:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npx tauri dev"
            yarn="yarn tauri dev"
            pnpm="pnpm tauri dev"
            deno="deno task tauri dev"
            bun="bun tauri dev"
            cargo="cargo tauri dev"
        />

        This command will compile the Rust code and open a window with your web content.

</Steps>

**Congratulations!** You've created a new Tauri project using the Tauri CLI! 🚀

## Next Steps

- [Add and Configure a Frontend Framework](/start/frontend/)

- [Discover additional features to extend Tauri](/plugin/)

# Frontend Configuration

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tauri is frontend agnostic and supports most frontend frameworks out of the box. However, sometimes a framework need a bit of extra configuration to integrate with Tauri. Below is a list of frameworks with recommended configurations.

If a framework is not listed then it may work with Tauri with no additional configuration needed or it could have not been documented yet. Any contributions to add a framework that may require additional configuration are welcome to help others in the Tauri community.

## Configuration Checklist

Conceptually Tauri acts as a static web host. You need to provide Tauri with a folder containing some mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript and possibly WASM that can be served to the webview Tauri provides.

Below is a checklist of common scenarios needed to integrate a frontend with Tauri:

{/* TODO: Link to core concept of SSG/SSR, etc. */}
{/* TODO: Link to mobile development server guide */}
{/* TODO: Concept of how to do a client-server relationship? */}

- Use static site generation (SSG), single-page applications (SPA), or classic multi-page apps (MPA). Tauri does not natively support server based alternatives (such as SSR).
- For mobile development, a development server of some kind is necessary that can host the frontend on your internal IP.
- Use a proper client-server relationship between your app and your API's (no hybrid solutions with SSR).

## JavaScript

{/* TODO: Help me with the wording here lol */}
For most projects we recommend [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for SPA frameworks such as React, Vue, Svelte, and Solid, but also for plain JavaScript or TypeScript projects. Most other guides listed here show how to use Meta-Frameworks as they are typically designed for SSR and therefore require special configuration.

:::tip[Framework Not Listed?]

Don't see a framework listed? It may work with Tauri without any additional configuration required. Read the [configuration checklist](/start/frontend/#configuration-checklist) for any common configurations to check for.

:::

# Leptos

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

Leptos is a Rust based web framework. You can read more about Leptos on their [official website](https://leptos.dev/). This guide is accurate as of Leptos version 0.6.

## Checklist

- Use SSG, Tauri doesn't officially support server based solutions.
- Use `serve.ws_protocol = "ws"` so that the hot-reload websocket can connect properly for mobile development.
- Enable `withGlobalTauri` to ensure that Tauri APIs are available in the `window.__TAURI__` variable and can be imported using `wasm-bindgen`.

## Example Configuration

<Steps>

1. ##### Update Tauri configuration

   ```json
   // src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
   {
     "build": {
       "beforeDevCommand": "trunk serve",
       "devUrl": "http://localhost:1420",
       "beforeBuildCommand": "trunk build",
       "frontendDist": "../dist"
     },
     "app": {
       "withGlobalTauri": true
     }
   }
   ```

1. ##### Update Trunk configuration

   ```toml
   // Trunk.toml
   [build]
   target = "./index.html"

   [watch]
   ignore = ["./src-tauri"]

   [serve]
   port = 1420
   open = false
   ws_protocol = "ws"

   ```

</Steps>

# Next.js

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

Next.js is a meta framework for React. Learn more about Next.js at https://nextjs.org. This guide is accurate as of Next.js 14.2.3.

## Checklist

- Use static exports by setting `output: 'export'`. Tauri doesn't support server-based solutions.
- Use the `out` directory as `frontendDist` in `tauri.conf.json`.

# SvelteKit

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

SvelteKit is a meta framework for Svelte. Learn more about SvelteKit at https://svelte.dev/. This guide is accurate as of SvelteKit 2.20.4 / Svelte 5.25.8.

## Checklist

- Use [SSG](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static) and [SPA](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/single-page-apps) via `static-adapter`. Tauri doesn't support server-based solutions.
- If using SSG **with prerendering**, be aware that `load` functions will not have access to tauri APIs during the build process of your app. Using SPA mode (without prerendering) is recommended since the load functions will only run in the webview with access to tauri APIs.
- Use `build/` as `frontendDist` in `tauri.conf.json`.

## Example Configuration

<Steps>

1.  ##### Install `@sveltejs/adapter-static`

    <CommandTabs
      npm="npm install --save-dev @sveltejs/adapter-static"
      yarn="yarn add -D @sveltejs/adapter-static"
      pnpm="pnpm add -D @sveltejs/adapter-static"
      deno="deno add -D npm:@sveltejs/adapter-static"
    />

1.  ##### Update Tauri configuration

          <Tabs>

      <TabItem label="npm">

    ```json
    // tauri.conf.json
    {
      "build": {
        "beforeDevCommand": "npm run dev",
        "beforeBuildCommand": "npm run build",
        "devUrl": "http://localhost:5173",
        "frontendDist": "../build"
      }
    }

    <TabItem label="yarn">

    ```json
    // tauri.conf.json
    {
      "build": {
        "beforeDevCommand": "yarn dev",
        "beforeBuildCommand": "yarn build",
        "devUrl": "http://localhost:5173",
        "frontendDist": "../build"
      }
    }
    ```

          </TabItem>

        "beforeBuildCommand": "pnpm build",
        "devUrl": "http://localhost:5173",
        "frontendDist": "../build"
      }
    }

        "beforeBuildCommand": "deno task build",
        "devUrl": "http://localhost:5173",
        "frontendDist": "../build"
      }
    }
    ```

          </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

1.  ##### Update SvelteKit configuration:

    ```js title="svelte.config.js" {1}
    import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
    import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

    /** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
    const config = {
      // Consult https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/integrations#preprocessors
      // for more information about preprocessors
      preprocess: vitePreprocess(),

      kit: {
        adapter: adapter({
          fallback: 'index.html',
        }),
      },
    };

    export default config;
    ```

1.  ##### Disable SSR

    Lastly, we need to disable SSR by adding a root `+layout.ts` file (or `+layout.js` if you are not using TypeScript) with these contents:

    ```ts
    // src/routes/+layout.ts
    export const ssr = false;
    ```

    Note that `static-adapter` doesn't require you to disable SSR for the whole app but it makes it possible to use APIs that depend on the global window object (like Tauri's API) without [Client-side checks](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/faq#how-do-i-use-x-with-sveltekit-how-do-i-use-a-client-side-only-library-that-depends-on-document-or-window).

    Furthermore, if you prefer Static Site Generation (SSG) over Single-Page Application (SPA) mode, you can change the adapter configurations and `+layout.ts` according to the [adapter docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static).

</Steps>

# Trunk

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Learn more about Trunk at https://trunkrs.dev. This guide is accurate as of Trunk 0.17.5.

## Checklist

- Use SSG, Tauri doesn't officially support server based solutions.
- Use `serve.ws_protocol = "ws"` so that the hot-reload websocket can connect properly for mobile development.
- Enable `withGlobalTauri` to ensure that Tauri APIs are available in the `window.__TAURI__` variable and can be imported using `wasm-bindgen`.

## Example Configuration

<Steps>

1. ##### Update Tauri configuration

   ```json
   // tauri.conf.json
   {
     "build": {
       "beforeDevCommand": "trunk serve",
       "beforeBuildCommand": "trunk build",
       "devUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
       "frontendDist": "../dist"
     },
     "app": {
       "withGlobalTauri": true
     }
   }
   ```

1. ##### Update Trunk configuration

   ```toml
   # Trunk.toml
   [watch]
   ignore = ["./src-tauri"]

   [serve]
   ws_protocol = "ws"
   ```

</Steps>

# Vite

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
This guide is accurate as of Vite 5.4.8.

## Checklist

- Use `../dist` as `frontendDist` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
- Use `process.env.TAURI_DEV_HOST` as the development server host IP when set to run on iOS physical devices.

## Example configuration

<Steps>

1.  ##### Update Tauri configuration

    Assuming you have the following `dev` and `build` scripts in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "tsc && vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview",
        "tauri": "tauri"
      }
    }
    ```

    You can configure the Tauri CLI to use your Vite development server and dist folder
    along with the hooks to automatically run the Vite scripts:

    const host = process.env.TAURI_DEV_HOST;

    export default defineConfig({
      // prevent vite from obscuring rust errors
      clearScreen: false,
      server: {
        // make sure this port matches the devUrl port in tauri.conf.json file
        port: 5173,
        // Tauri expects a fixed port, fail if that port is not available
        strictPort: true,
        // if the host Tauri is expecting is set, use it
        host: host || false,
        hmr: host
          ? {
              protocol: 'ws',
              host,
              port: 1421,
            }
          : undefined,

        watch: {
          // tell vite to ignore watching `src-tauri`
          ignored: ['**/src-tauri/**'],
        },
      },
      // Env variables starting with the item of `envPrefix` will be exposed in tauri's source code through `import.meta.env`.
      envPrefix: ['VITE_', 'TAURI_ENV_*'],
      build: {
        // Tauri uses Chromium on Windows and WebKit on macOS and Linux
        target:
          process.env.TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM == 'windows'
            ? 'chrome105'
            : 'safari13',
        // don't minify for debug builds
        minify: !process.env.TAURI_ENV_DEBUG ? 'esbuild' : false,

</CardGrid>

# Upgrade from Tauri 1.0

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

This guide walks you through upgrading your Tauri 1.0 application to Tauri 2.0.

## Preparing for Mobile

The mobile interface of Tauri requires your project to output a shared library. If you are targeting mobile for your existing application, you must change your crate to produce that kind of artifact along with the desktop executable.

1. Change the Cargo manifest to produce the library. Append the following block:

```toml
// src-tauri/Cargo.toml
[lib]
name = "app_lib"
crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib", "rlib"]
```

2. Rename `src-tauri/src/main.rs` to `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. This file will be shared by both desktop and mobile targets.

3. Rename the `main` function header in `lib.rs` to the following:

```rust
// src-tauri/src/lib.rs
#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
pub fn run() {
    // your code here
}
```

The `tauri::mobile_entry_point` macro prepares your function to be executed on mobile.

4. Recreate the `main.rs` file calling the shared run function:

```rust
// src-tauri/src/main.rs
#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]

fn main() {
  app_lib::run();
}
```

## Automated Migration

:::danger

This command is not a substitude for this guide! Please read the _whole_ page regardless of whether you chose to use the command.

:::

The Tauri v2 CLI includes a `migrate` command that automates most of the process and helps you finish the migration:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest
    npm run tauri migrate"
  yarn="yarn upgrade @tauri-apps/cli@latest
    yarn tauri migrate"
  pnpm="pnpm update @tauri-apps/cli@latest
    pnpm tauri migrate"
  cargo='cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0" --locked
    cargo tauri migrate'
/>

Learn more about the `migrate` command in the [Command Line Interface reference](/reference/cli/#migrate)

The v1 plugins are now published as `@tauri-apps/plugin-<plugin-name>`. Previously they were available from git as `tauri-plugin-<plugin-name>-api`.

### Environment Variables Changes

Most of the environment variables read and written by the Tauri CLI were renamed for consistency and prevention of mistakes:

- `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` -> `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` -> `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `TAURI_SKIP_DEVSERVER_CHECK` -> `TAURI_CLI_NO_DEV_SERVER_WAIT`
- `TAURI_DEV_SERVER_PORT` -> `TAURI_CLI_PORT`
- `TAURI_PATH_DEPTH` -> `TAURI_CLI_CONFIG_DEPTH`
- `TAURI_FIPS_COMPLIANT` -> `TAURI_BUNDLER_WIX_FIPS_COMPLIANT`
- `TAURI_DEV_WATCHER_IGNORE_FILE` -> `TAURI_CLI_WATCHER_IGNORE_FILENAME`
- `TAURI_TRAY` -> `TAURI_LINUX_AYATANA_APPINDICATOR`
- `TAURI_APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` -> `APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`
- `TAURI_PLATFORM` -> `TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM`
- `TAURI_ARCH` -> `TAURI_ENV_ARCH`
- `TAURI_FAMILY` -> `TAURI_ENV_FAMILY`
- `TAURI_PLATFORM_VERSION` -> `TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_VERSION`
- `TAURI_PLATFORM_TYPE` -> `TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_TYPE`
- `TAURI_DEBUG` -> `TAURI_ENV_DEBUG`

### Event System

The event system was redesigned to be easier to use. Instead of relying on the source of the event, it now has a simpler implementation that relies on event targets.

- The `emit` function now emits the event to all event listeners.
- Added a new `emit_to`/`emitTo` function to trigger an event to a specific target.
- `emit_filter` now filters based on [`EventTarget`](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/event/enum.EventTarget.html) instead of a window.
- Renamed `listen_global` to `listen_any`. It now listens to all events regardless of their filters and targets.
- JavaScript: `event.listen()` behaves similar to `listen_any`. It now listens to all events regardless of their filters and targets, unless a target is set in the `Options`.
- JavaScript: `WebviewWindow.listen` etc. only listen to events emitted to the respective `EventTarget`.

### Multiwebview support

Tauri v2 introduces multiwebview support currently behind an `unstable` feature flag.
In order to support it, we renamed the Rust `Window` type to `WebviewWindow` and the Manager `get_window` function to `get_webview_window`.

The `WebviewWindow` JS API type is now re-exported from `@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow` instead of `@tauri-apps/api/window`.

### New origin URL on Windows

On Windows the frontend files in production apps are now hosted on `http://tauri.localhost` instead of `https://tauri.localhost`. Because of this IndexedDB, LocalStorage and Cookies will be reset unless `dangerousUseHttpScheme` was used in v1. To prevent this you can set `app > windows > useHttpsScheme` to `true` or use `WebviewWindowBuilder::use_https_scheme` to keep using the `https` scheme.

## Detailed Migration Steps

Common scenarios you may encounter when migrating your Tauri 1.0 app to Tauri 2.0.

### Migrate to Core Module

The `@tauri-apps/api/tauri` module was renamed to `@tauri-apps/api/core`.
Simply rename the module import:

```diff
- import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/tauri"
+ import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core"
```

### Migrate to CLI Plugin

The Rust `App::get_cli_matches` JavaScript `@tauri-apps/api/cli` APIs have been removed. Use the `@tauri-apps/plugin-cli` plugin instead:

1. Add to cargo dependencies:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-cli = "2"
```

2. Use in JavaScript or Rust project:

### Migrate to Menu Module

The Rust `Menu` APIs were moved to the `tauri::menu` module and refactored to use the [muda crate](https://github.com/tauri-apps/muda).

#### Use `tauri::menu::MenuBuilder`

Use `tauri::menu::MenuBuilder` instead of `tauri::Menu`. Note that its constructor takes a Manager instance (one of `App`, `AppHandle` or `WebviewWindow`) as an argument:

```rust
use tauri::menu::MenuBuilder;

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app)
            .copy()
            .paste()
            .separator()
            .undo()
            .redo()
            .text("open-url", "Open URL")
            .check("toggle", "Toggle")
            .icon("show-app", "Show App", app.default_window_icon().cloned().unwrap())
            .build()?;
        Ok(())
    })
```

#### Use `tauri::menu::PredefinedMenuItem`

Use `tauri::menu::PredefinedMenuItem` instead of `tauri::MenuItem`:

```rust
use tauri::menu::{MenuBuilder, PredefinedMenuItem};

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app).item(&PredefinedMenuItem::copy(app)?).build()?;
        Ok(())
    })
```

:::tip
The menu builder has dedicated methods to add each predefined menu item so you can call `.copy()` instead of `.item(&PredefinedMenuItem::copy(app, None)?)`.
:::

#### Use `tauri::menu::MenuItemBuilder`

Use `tauri::menu::MenuItemBuilder` instead of `tauri::CustomMenuItem`:

```rust
use tauri::menu::MenuItemBuilder;

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let toggle = MenuItemBuilder::new("Toggle").accelerator("Ctrl+Shift+T").build(app)?;
        Ok(())
    })
```

#### Use `tauri::menu::SubmenuBuilder`

Use `tauri::menu::SubmenuBuilder` instead of `tauri::Submenu`:

```rust
use tauri::menu::{MenuBuilder, SubmenuBuilder};

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let submenu = SubmenuBuilder::new(app, "Sub")
            .text("Tauri")
            .separator()
            .check("Is Awesome")
            .build()?;
        let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app).item(&submenu).build()?;
        Ok(())
    })
```

`tauri::Builder::menu` now takes a closure because the menu needs a Manager instance to be built. See [the documentation](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/struct.Builder.html#method.menu) for more information.

#### Menu Events

The Rust `tauri::Builder::on_menu_event` API was removed. Use `tauri::App::on_menu_event` or `tauri::AppHandle::on_menu_event` instead:

```rust
use tauri::menu::{CheckMenuItemBuilder, MenuBuilder, MenuItemBuilder};

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let toggle = MenuItemBuilder::with_id("toggle", "Toggle").build(app)?;
        let check = CheckMenuItemBuilder::new("Mark").build(app)?;
        let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app).items(&[&toggle, &check]).build()?;

        app.set_menu(menu)?;

        app.on_menu_event(move |app, event| {
            if event.id() == check.id() {
                println!("`check` triggered, do something! is checked? {}", check.is_checked().unwrap());
            } else if event.id() == "toggle" {
                println!("toggle triggered!");
            }
        });
        Ok(())
    })
```

Note that there are two ways to check which menu item was selected: move the item to the event handler closure and compare IDs, or define a custom ID for the item through the `with_id` constructor and use that ID string to compare.

:::tip
Menu items can be shared across menus, and the menu event is bound to a menu item instead of a menu or window.
If you don't want all listeners to be triggered when a menu item is selected, do not share menu items and use dedicated instances instead, that you could move into `tauri::WebviewWindow/WebviewWindowBuilder::on_menu_event` closure.

            assert_eq!(String::from_utf8(output.stdout).unwrap(), "TAURI");
            Ok(())
        })
}
```

- Spawn a child process and read its events asynchronously:

```rust
use tauri_plugin_shell::{ShellExt, process::CommandEvent};

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_shell::init())
        .setup(|app| {
            let handle = app.handle().clone();
            tauri::async_runtime::spawn(async move {
                let (mut rx, mut child) = handle.shell().command("cargo")
                    .args(["tauri", "dev"])
                    .spawn()
                    .expect("Failed to spawn cargo");

### Migrate to Tray Icon Module

The Rust `SystemTray` APIs were renamed to `TrayIcon` for consistency. The new APIs can be found in the Rust `tray` module.

#### Use `tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder`

Use `tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder` instead of `tauri::SystemTray`:

```rust
let tray = tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder::with_id("my-tray").build(app)?;
```

See [TrayIconBuilder](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/tray/struct.TrayIconBuilder.html) for more information.

#### Migrate to Menu

Use `tauri::menu::Menu` instead of `tauri::SystemTrayMenu`, `tauri::menu::Submenu` instead of `tauri::SystemTraySubmenu` and `tauri::menu::PredefinedMenuItem` instead of `tauri::SystemTrayMenuItem`.

#### Tray Events

`tauri::SystemTray::on_event` have been split into `tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder::on_menu_event` and `tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder::on_tray_icon_event`:

```rust
use tauri::{
    menu::{MenuBuilder, MenuItemBuilder},
    tray::{MouseButton, MouseButtonState, TrayIconBuilder, TrayIconEvent},
};

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let toggle = MenuItemBuilder::with_id("toggle", "Toggle").build(app)?;
        let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app).items(&[&toggle]).build()?;
        let tray = TrayIconBuilder::new()
            .menu(&menu)
            .on_menu_event(move |app, event| match event.id().as_ref() {
                "toggle" => {
                    println!("toggle clicked");
                }
                _ => (),
            })
            .on_tray_icon_event(|tray, event| {
                if let TrayIconEvent::Click {
                        button: MouseButton::Left,
                        button_state: MouseButtonState::Up,
                        ..
                } = event
                {
                    let app = tray.app_handle();
                    if let Some(webview_window) = app.get_webview_window("main") {
                    let _ = webview_window.show();
                    let _ = webview_window.set_focus();
                    }
                }
            })
            .build(app)?;

        Ok(())
    })
```

### Migrate to Updater Plugin

:::caution[Change of default behavior]

The built-in dialog with an automatic update check was removed, use the Rust and JS APIs to check for and install updates instead. Failing to do so will prevent your users from getting further updates!

:::

The Rust `tauri::updater` and JavaScript `@tauri-apps/api-updater` APIs have been removed. To set a custom updater target with the `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater`:

1. Add to cargo dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-updater = "2"
```

2. Use in JavaScript or Rust project:

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_updater::Builder::new().build())
}
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tauri-apps/plugin-updater": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

```javascript
import { check } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-updater';
import { relaunch } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-process';

const update = await check();
if (update?.available) {
  console.log(`Update to ${update.version} available! Date: ${update.date}`);
  console.log(`Release notes: ${update.body}`);
  await update.downloadAndInstall();
  // requires the `process` plugin
  await relaunch();
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Rust">

To check for updates:

```rust
use tauri_plugin_updater::UpdaterExt;

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_updater::Builder::new().build())
        .setup(|app| {
            let handle = app.handle();
            tauri::async_runtime::spawn(async move {
                let response = handle.updater().check().await;
            });
            Ok(())
        })
}
```

To set a custom updater target:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut updater = tauri_plugin_updater::Builder::new();
    #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
    {
        updater = updater.target("darwin-universal");
    }
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(updater.build())
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Migrate Path to Tauri Manager

The Rust `tauri::api::path` module functions and `tauri::PathResolver` have been moved to `tauri::Manager::path`:

```rust
use tauri::{path::BaseDirectory, Manager};

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let home_dir_path = app.path().home_dir().expect("failed to get home dir");

        let path = app.path().resolve("path/to/something", BaseDirectory::Config)?;

        Ok(())
  })
```

### Migrate to new Window API

On the Rust side, `Window` was renamed to `WebviewWindow`, its builder `WindowBuilder` is now named `WebviewWindowBuilder` and `WindowUrl` is now named `WebviewUrl`.

Additionally, the `Manager::get_window` function was renamed to `get_webview_window` and
the window's `parent_window` API was renamed to `parent_raw` to support a high level window parent API.

On the JavaScript side, the `WebviewWindow` class is now exported in the `@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow` path.

The `onMenuClicked` function was removed, you can intercept menu events when creating a menu in JavaScript instead.

### Migrate Embedded Additional Files (Resources)

On the JavaScript side, make sure you [Migrate to File System Plugin](#migrate-to-file-system-plugin).
Additionally, note the changes made to the v1 allowlist in [Migrate Permissions](#migrate-permissions).

On the Rust side, make sure you [Migrate Path to Tauri Manager](#migrate-path-to-tauri-manager).

### Migrate Embedded External Binaries (Sidecar)

In Tauri v1, the external binaries and their arguments were defined in the allowlist. In v2, use the new permissions system. Read [Migrate Permissions](#migrate-permissions) for more information.

On the JavaScript side, make sure you [Migrate to Shell Plugin](#migrate-to-shell-plugin).

On the Rust side, `tauri::api::process` API has been removed. Use `tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt` and `tauri_plugin_shell::process::CommandEvent` APIs instead. Read the [Embedding External Binaries](/develop/sidecar/#running-it-from-rust) guide to see how.

The "process-command-api" features flag has been removed in v2. So running the external binaries does not require this feature to be defined in the Tauri config anymore.

### Migrate Permissions

The v1 allowlist have been rewritten to a completely new system for permissions that works for individual plugins and is much more configurable for multiwindow and remote URL support.
This new system works like an access control list (ACL) where you can allow or deny commands, allocate permissions to a specific set of windows and domains, and define access scopes.

To enable permissions for your app, you must create capability files inside the `src-tauri/capabilities` folder, and Tauri will automatically configure everything else for you.

The `migrate` CLI command automatically parses your v1 allowlist and generates the associated capability file.

To learn more about permissions and capabilities, see [the security documentation](/security/).

# Upgrade from Tauri 2.0 Beta

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

This guide walks you through upgrading your Tauri 2.0 beta application to Tauri 2.0 release candidate.

## Automated Migration

The Tauri v2 CLI includes a `migrate` command that automates most of the process and helps you finish the migration:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest
    npm run tauri migrate"
  yarn="yarn upgrade @tauri-apps/cli@latest
    yarn tauri migrate"
  pnpm="pnpm update @tauri-apps/cli@latest
    pnpm tauri migrate"
  cargo='cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0" --locked
    cargo tauri migrate'
/>

Learn more about the `migrate` command in the [Command Line Interface reference](/reference/cli/#migrate)

## Breaking Changes

We have had several breaking changes going from beta to release candidate. These can be either auto-migrated (see above) or manually performed.

### Tauri Core Plugins

We changed how Tauri built-in plugins are addressed in the capabilities [PR #10390](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10390).

To migrate from the latest beta version you need to prepend all core permission identifiers in your capabilities with `core:` or switch to the `core:default` permission and remove old core plugin identifiers.

```json
...
"permissions": [
    "path:default",
    "event:default",
    "window:default",
    "app:default",
    "image:default",
    "resources:default",
    "menu:default",
    "tray:default",
]
...
```

```json
...
"permissions": [
    "core:path:default",
    "core:event:default",
    "core:window:default",
    "core:app:default",
    "core:image:default",
    "core:resources:default",
    "core:menu:default",
    "core:tray:default",
]
...
```

We also added a new special `core:default` permission set which will contain all default permissions of all core plugins, so you can simplify the permissions boilerplate in your capabilities config.

```json
...
"permissions": [
    "core:default"
]
...
```

### Built-In Development Server

We introduced changes to the network exposure of the built-in development server [PR #10437](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10437) and [PR #10456](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10456).

The built-in mobile development server no longer exposes network wide and tunnels traffic from the local machine directly to the device.

Currently this improvement does not automatically apply when running on iOS devices (either directly or from Xcode).
In this case we default to using the public network address for the development server,
but there's a way around it which involves opening Xcode to automatically start a connection between your macOS machine and your connected iOS device,
then running `tauri ios dev --force-ip-prompt` to select the iOS device's TUN address (ends with **::2**).

Your development server configuration needs to adapt to this change if running on a physical iOS device is intended.
Previously we recommended checking if the `TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM` environment variable matches either `android` or `ios`,
but since we can now connect to localhost unless using an iOS device, you should instead check the `TAURI_DEV_HOST` environment variable.
Here's an example of a Vite configuration migration:

- 2.0.0-beta:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { svelte } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';
import { internalIpV4Sync } from 'internal-ip';

const mobile = !!/android|ios/.exec(process.env.TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM);

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [svelte()],
  clearScreen: false,
  server: {
    host: mobile ? '0.0.0.0' : false,
    port: 1420,
    strictPort: true,
    hmr: mobile
      ? {
          protocol: 'ws',
          host: internalIpV4Sync(),
          port: 1421,
        }
      : undefined,
  },
});
```

- 2.0.0:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import Unocss from 'unocss/vite';
import { svelte } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

const host = process.env.TAURI_DEV_HOST;

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [svelte()],
  clearScreen: false,
  server: {
    host: host || false,
    port: 1420,
    strictPort: true,
    hmr: host
      ? {
          protocol: 'ws',
          host: host,
          port: 1430,
        }
      : undefined,
  },
});
```

:::note
The `internal-ip` NPM package is no longer required, you can directly use the TAURI_DEV_HOST value instead.

If your distribution isn't included above then you may want to check [Awesome Tauri on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri#guides) to see if a guide has been created.

Next: [Install Rust](#rust)

### macOS

Tauri uses [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) and various macOS and iOS development dependencies.

Download and install Xcode from one of the following places:

- [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/).

Be sure to launch Xcode after installing so that it can finish setting up.

<details>
<summary>Only developing for desktop targets?</summary>
If you're only planning to develop desktop apps and not targeting iOS then you can install Xcode Command Line Tools instead:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

</details>

Next: [Install Rust](#rust)

### Windows

Tauri uses the Microsoft C++ Build Tools for development as well as Microsoft Edge WebView2. These are both required for development on Windows.

Follow the steps below to install the required dependencies.

#### Microsoft C++ Build Tools

1. Download the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) installer and open it to begin installation.
2. During installation check the "Desktop development with C++" option.

![Visual Studio C++ Build Tools installer screenshot](@assets/start/prerequisites/visual-studio-build-tools-installer.png)

Next: [Install WebView2](#webview2).

#### WebView2

:::tip
WebView 2 is already installed on Windows 10 (from version 1803 onward) and later versions of Windows. If you are developing on one of these versions then you can skip this step and go directly to [installing Rust](#rust).
:::

Tauri uses Microsoft Edge WebView2 to render content on Windows.

Install WebView2 by visiting the [WebView2 Runtime download section](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section). Download the "Evergreen Bootstrapper" and install it.

Next: [Check VBSCRIPT](#vbscript-for-msi-installers)

#### VBSCRIPT (for MSI installers)

:::note[MSI package building only]
This is only required if you plan to build MSI installer packages (`"targets": "msi"` or `"targets": "all"` in `tauri.conf.json`).
:::

Building MSI packages on Windows requires the VBSCRIPT optional feature to be enabled. This feature is enabled by default on most Windows installations, but may have been disabled on some systems.

If you encounter errors like `failed to run light.exe` when building MSI packages, you may need to enable the VBSCRIPT feature:

1. Open **Settings** → **Apps** → **Optional features** → **More Windows features**
2. Locate **VBSCRIPT** in the list and ensure it's checked
3. Click **Next** and restart your computer if prompted

**Note:** VBSCRIPT is currently enabled by default on most Windows installations, but is [being deprecated](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/vbscript-deprecation-timelines-and-next-steps/4148301) and may be disabled in future Windows versions.

Next: [Install Rust](#rust)

## Rust

Tauri is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and requires it for development. Install Rust using one of following methods. You can view more installation methods at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
  <TabItem label="Linux and macOS" class="content">

Install via [`rustup`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup) using the following command:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

:::tip[Security Tip]
We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first.

Here is the file as a plain script: [rustup.sh](https://sh.rustup.rs/)
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">

Visit https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install to install `rustup`.

Alternatively, you can use `winget` to install rustup using the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install --id Rustlang.Rustup
```

:::caution[MSVC toolchain as default]

For full support for Tauri and tools like [`trunk`](https://trunkrs.dev/) make sure the MSVC Rust toolchain is the selected `default host triple` in the installer dialog. Depending on your system it should be either `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, `i686-pc-windows-msvc`, or `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`.

If you already have Rust installed, you can make sure the correct toolchain is installed by running this command:

```powershell
rustup default stable-msvc
```

:::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Be sure to restart your Terminal (and in some cases your system) for the changes to take affect.**

Next: [Configure for Mobile Targets](#configure-for-mobile-targets) if you'd like to build for Android and iOS, or, if you'd like to use a JavaScript framework, [install Node](#nodejs). Otherwise [Create a Project](/start/create-project/).

## Node.js

:::note[JavaScript ecosystem]
Only if you intend to use a JavaScript frontend framework
:::

1. Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org), download the Long Term Support (LTS) version and install it.

2. Check if Node was successfully installed by running:

```sh
node -v
# v20.10.0
npm -v
# 10.2.3
```

It's important to restart your Terminal to ensure it recognizes the new installation. In some cases, you might need to restart your computer.

While npm is the default package manager for Node.js, you can also use others like pnpm or yarn. To enable these, run `corepack enable` in your Terminal. This step is optional and only needed if you prefer using a package manager other than npm.

Next: [Configure for Mobile Targets](#configure-for-mobile-targets) or [Create a project](/start/create-project/).

## Configure for Mobile Targets

If you'd like to target your app for Android or iOS then there are a few additional dependencies that you need to install:

- [Android](#android)
- [iOS](#ios)

### Android

1. Download and install [Android Studio from the Android Developers website](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

{/* TODO: Can this be done in the 4th step? */}

<Tabs syncKey="prereqs">
<TabItem label="Linux">

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS">

```sh
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">

```ps
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JAVA_HOME", "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr", "User")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
3. Use the SDK Manager in Android Studio to install the following:

- Android SDK Platform
- Android SDK Platform-Tools
- NDK (Side by side)
- Android SDK Build-Tools
- Android SDK Command-line Tools

Selecting "Show Package Details" in the SDK Manager enables the installation of older package versions. Only install older versions if necessary, as they may introduce compatibility issues or security risks.

4. Set `ANDROID_HOME` and `NDK_HOME` environment variables.

<Tabs syncKey="prereqs">
<TabItem label="Linux">

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk"
export NDK_HOME="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/$(ls -1 $ANDROID_HOME/ndk)"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS">

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export NDK_HOME="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/$(ls -1 $ANDROID_HOME/ndk)"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">

```ps
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANDROID_HOME", "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk", "User")
$VERSION = Get-ChildItem -Name "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk\ndk" | Select-Object -Last 1
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NDK_HOME", "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk\ndk\$VERSION", "User")
```

:::tip
Most apps don't refresh their environment variables automatically, so to let them pickup the changes,
you can either restart your terminal and IDE or for your current PowerShell session, you can refresh it with

# Tauri Architecture

## Introduction

Tauri is a polyglot and generic toolkit that is very composable and allows engineers to make a wide variety of applications. It is used for building applications for desktop computers using a combination of Rust tools and HTML rendered in a Webview. Apps built with Tauri can ship with any number of pieces of an optional JS API and Rust API so that webviews can control the system via message passing. Developers can extend the default API with their own functionality and bridge the Webview and Rust-based backend easily.

Tauri apps can have [tray-type interfaces](/learn/system-tray/). They can be [updated](/plugin/updater/) and are managed by the user's operating system as expected. They are very small because they use the OS's webview. They do not ship a runtime since the final binary is compiled from Rust. This makes the [reversing of Tauri apps not a trivial task](/security/).

### What Tauri is Not

Tauri is not a lightweight kernel wrapper. Instead, it directly uses [WRY](#wry) and [TAO](#tao) to do the heavy lifting in making system calls to the OS.

Tauri is not a VM or virtualized environment. Instead, it is an application toolkit that allows making Webview OS applications.

### tauri

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri)

This is the major crate that holds everything together. It brings the runtimes, macros, utilities and API into one final product. It reads the [`tauri.conf.json`](/reference/config/) file at compile time to bring in features and undertake the actual configuration of the app (and even the `Cargo.toml` file in the project's folder). It handles script injection (for polyfills / prototype revision) at runtime, hosts the API for systems interaction, and even manages the updating process.

### tauri-runtime

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-runtime)

The glue layer between Tauri itself and lower-level webview libraries.

### tauri-macros

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-macros)

Creates macros for the context, handler, and commands by leveraging the [`tauri-codegen`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-codegen) crate.

### tauri-utils

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-utils)

Common code that is reused in many places and offers useful utilities like parsing configuration files, detecting platform triples, injecting the CSP, and managing assets.

### tauri-build

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-build)

Applies the macros at build-time to rig some special features needed by `cargo`.

### tauri-codegen

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-codegen)

Embeds, hashes, and compresses assets, including icons for the app as well as the system tray. Parses [`tauri.conf.json`](/reference/config/) at compile time and generates the Config struct.

### tauri-runtime-wry

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-runtime-wry)

This crate opens up direct systems-level interactions specifically for WRY, such as printing, monitor detection, and other windowing-related tasks.

## Tauri Tooling

### API (JavaScript / TypeScript)

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/packages/api)

A typescript library that creates `cjs` and `esm` JavaScript endpoints for you to import into your frontend framework so that the Webview can call and listen to backend activity. Also ships in pure typescript, because for some frameworks this is more optimal. It uses the message passing of webviews to their hosts.

### Bundler (Rust / Shell)

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-bundler)

A library that builds a Tauri app for the platform it detects or is told. Currently supports macOS, Windows and Linux - but in the near future will support mobile platforms as well. May be used outside of Tauri projects.

### cli.rs (Rust)

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-cli)

This Rust executable provides the full interface to all of the required activities for which the CLI is required. It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### cli.js (JavaScript)

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/packages/cli)

Wrapper around [`cli.rs`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/crates/tauri-cli) using [`napi-rs`](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) to produce npm packages for each platform.

### create-tauri-app (JavaScript)

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app)

A toolkit that will enable engineering teams to rapidly scaffold out a new `tauri-apps` project using the frontend framework of their choice (as long as it has been configured).

## Upstream Crates

The Tauri-Apps organization maintains two "upstream" crates from Tauri, namely TAO for creating and managing application windows, and WRY for interfacing with the Webview that lives within the window.

### TAO

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao)

Cross-platform application window creation library in Rust that supports all major platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. Written in Rust, it is a fork of [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) that we have extended for our own needs - like menu bar and system tray.

### WRY

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry)

WRY is a cross-platform WebView rendering library in Rust that supports all major desktop platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Tauri uses WRY as the abstract layer responsible to determine which webview is used (and how interactions are made).

## Additional Tooling

### tauri-action

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action)

GitHub workflow that builds Tauri binaries for all platforms. Even allows creating a (very basic) Tauri app even if Tauri is not set up.

### tauri-vscode

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-vscode)

This project enhances the Visual Studio Code interface with several nice-to-have features.

### vue-cli-plugin-tauri

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/vue-cli-plugin-tauri)

Allows you to very quickly install Tauri in a vue-cli project.

## Plugins

[Tauri Plugin Guide](/develop/plugins/)

Generally speaking, plugins are authored by third parties (even though there may be official, supported plugins). A plugin generally does 3 things:

1. Enables Rust code to do "something".
2. Provides interface glue to make it easy to integrate into an app.
3. Provides a JavaScript API for interfacing with the Rust code.

Here are some examples of Tauri Plugins:

- [tauri-plugin-fs](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-fs)
- [tauri-plugin-sql](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-sql)
- [tauri-plugin-stronghold](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-stronghold)

## License

Tauri itself is licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0. If you repackage it and modify any source code, it is your responsibility to verify that you are complying with all upstream licenses. Tauri is provided AS-IS with no explicit claim for suitability for any purpose.

# Inter-Process Communication

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) allows isolated processes to communicate securely and is key to building more complex applications.

Learn more about the specific IPC patterns in the following guides:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Brownfield"
    href="/concept/inter-process-communication/brownfield/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Isolation"
    href="/concept/inter-process-communication/isolation/"
  />
</CardGrid>

Tauri uses a particular style of Inter-Process Communication called [Asynchronous Message Passing], where processes exchange _requests_ and _responses_ serialized using some simple data representation. Message Passing should sound familiar to anyone with web development experience, as this paradigm is used for client-server communication on the internet.

Message passing is a safer technique than shared memory or direct function access because the recipient is free to reject or discard requests as it sees fit. For example, if the Tauri Core process determines a request to be malicious, it simply discards the requests and never executes the corresponding function.

In the following, we explain Tauri's two IPC primitives - `Events` and `Commands` - in more detail.

## Events

Events are fire-and-forget, one-way IPC messages that are best suited to communicate lifecycle events and state changes. Unlike [Commands](#commands), Events can be emitted by both the Frontend _and_ the Tauri Core.

<figure>

```d2 sketch pad=50

}

Frontend -> Core: "Event"{style.animated: true}
Core -> Frontend: "Event"{style.animated: true}
```

<figcaption>Events sent between the Core and the Webview.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Commands

Tauri also provides a [foreign function interface]-like abstraction on top of IPC messages[^1]. The primary API, `invoke`, is similar to the browser's `fetch` API and allows the Frontend to invoke Rust functions, pass arguments, and receive data.

Because this mechanism uses a [JSON-RPC] like protocol under the hood to serialize requests and responses, all arguments and return data must be serializable to JSON.

<figure>

```d2 sketch pad=50
shape: sequence_diagram


Frontend: {
  label: "Webview\nFrontend"
}

Core: {
  label: "Core\nBackend"
}
InvokeHandler: {
  label: "Invoke\nHandler"
}

Frontend -> Core: "IPC Request"{style.animated: true}
Core -> InvokeHandler: "Invoke command"{style.animated: true}
InvokeHandler -> Core: "Serialize return"{style.animated: true}
Core -> Frontend: "Response"{style.animated: true}
```

<figcaption>IPC messages involved in a command invocation.</figcaption>

[^1]: Because Commands still use message passing under the hood, they do not share the same security pitfalls as real FFI interfaces do.

# Brownfield Pattern

_**This is the default pattern.**_

This is the simplest and most straightforward pattern to use Tauri with, because it tries to be as compatible as possible with existing frontend projects. In short, it tries to require nothing
additional to what an existing web frontend might use inside a browser.
Not _**everything**_ that works in existing browser applications will work out-of-the-box.

If you are unfamiliar with Brownfield software development in general, the [Brownfield Wikipedia article]
provides a nice summary. For Tauri, the existing software is current browser support and behavior, instead of
legacy systems.

## Configuration

Because the Brownfield pattern is the default pattern, it doesn't require a configuration option to be set. To explicitly set
it, you can use the `app > security > pattern` object in the `tauri.conf.json` configuration file.

```json
{
  "app": {
    "security": {
      "pattern": {
        "use": "brownfield"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

_**There are no additional configuration options for the brownfield pattern.**_

[brownfield wikipedia article]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)

# Isolation Pattern

The Isolation pattern is a way to intercept and modify Tauri API messages sent by the frontend before they get to Tauri Core, all with JavaScript. The secure JavaScript code that is injected by the Isolation pattern is referred to as the Isolation application.

## Why

The Isolation pattern's purpose is to provide a mechanism for developers to help protect their application from unwanted or malicious frontend calls to Tauri Core. The need for the Isolation pattern rose out of threats coming from untrusted content running on the frontend, a common case for applications with many dependencies. See [Security: Threat Models] for a list of many sources of threats that an application may see.

The largest threat model described above that the Isolation pattern was designed in mind was Development Threats. Not only do many frontend build-time tools consist of many dozen (or hundreds) of often deeply-nested dependencies, but a complex application may also have a large amount of (also often deeply-nested) dependencies that are bundled into the final output.

## When

Tauri highly recommends using the isolation pattern whenever it can be used. Because the Isolation application intercepts _**all**_ messages from the frontend, it can _always_ be used.

Tauri also strongly suggests locking down your application whenever you use external Tauri APIs. As the developer, you can utilize the secure Isolation application to try and verify IPC inputs, to make sure they are within some expected parameters. For example, you may want to check that a call to read or write a file is not trying to access a path outside your application's expected locations. Another example is making sure that a Tauri API HTTP fetch call is only setting the Origin header to what your application expects it to be.

That said, it intercepts _**all**_ messages from the frontend, so it will even work with always-on APIs such as [Events]. Since some events may cause your own rust code to perform actions, the same sort of validation techniques can be used with them.

## How

The Isolation pattern is all about injecting a secure application in between your frontend and Tauri Core to intercept and modify incoming IPC messages. It does this by using the sandboxing feature of `<iframe>`s to run the JavaScript securely alongside the main frontend application. Tauri enforces the Isolation pattern while loading the page, forcing all IPC calls to Tauri Core to instead be routed through the sandboxed Isolation application first. Once the message is ready to be passed to Tauri Core, it is encrypted using the browser's [SubtleCrypto] implementation and passed back to the main frontend application. Once there, it is directly passed to Tauri Core, where it is then decrypted and read like normal.

To ensure that someone cannot manually read the keys for a specific version of your application and use that to modify the messages after being encrypted, new keys are generated each time your application is run.

### Approximate Steps of an IPC Message

To make it easier to follow, here's an ordered list with the approximate steps an IPC message will go through when being sent to Tauri Core with the Isolation pattern:

1. Tauri's IPC handler receives a message
2. IPC handler -> Isolation application
3. `[sandbox]` Isolation application hook runs and potentially modifies the message
4. `[sandbox]` Message is encrypted with AES-GCM using a runtime-generated key
5. `[encrypted]` Isolation application -> IPC handler
6. `[encrypted]` IPC handler -> Tauri Core

_Note: Arrows (->) indicate message passing._

### Performance Implications

Because encryption of the message does occur, there are additional overhead costs compared to the [Brownfield pattern], even if the secure Isolation application doesn't do anything. Aside from performance-sensitive applications (who likely have a carefully-maintained and small set of dependencies, to keep the performance adequate), most applications should not notice the runtime costs of encrypting/decrypting the IPC messages, as they are relatively small and AES-GCM is relatively fast. If you are unfamiliar with AES-GCM, all that is relevant in this context is that it's the only authenticated mode algorithm included in [SubtleCrypto] and that you probably already use it every day under the hood with [TLS][transport_layer_security].

There is also a cryptographically secure key generated once each time the Tauri application is started. It is not generally noticeable if the system already has enough entropy to immediately return enough random numbers, which is extremely common for desktop environments. If running in a headless environment to perform some [integration testing with WebDriver] then you may want to install some sort of entropy-generating service such as `haveged` if your operating system does not have one included. <sup>Linux 5.6 (March 2020) now includes entropy generation using speculative execution.</sup>

### Limitations

There are a few limitations in the Isolation pattern that arose out of platform inconsistencies. The most significant limitation is due to external files not loading correctly inside sandboxed `<iframes>` on Windows. Because of this, we have implemented a simple script inlining step during build time that takes the content of scripts relative to the Isolation application and injects them inline. This means that typical bundling or simple including of files like `<script src="index.js"></script>` still works properly, but newer mechanisms such as ES Modules will _not_ successfully load.

## Recommendations

Because the point of the Isolation application is to protect against Development Threats, we highly recommend keeping your Isolation application as simple as possible. Not only should you strive to keep dependencies of your isolation application minimal, but you should also consider keeping its required build steps minimal. This would allow you to not need to worry about supply chain attacks against your Isolation application on top of your frontend application.

## Creating the Isolation Application

In this example, we will make a small hello-world style Isolation application and hook it up to an imaginary existing Tauri application. It will do no verification of the messages passing through it, only print the contents to the WebView console.

For the purposes of this example, let's imagine we are in the same directory as `tauri.conf.json`. The existing Tauri application has its `frontendDist` set to `../dist`.

`../dist-isolation/index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Isolation Secure Script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

`../dist-isolation/index.js`:

```javascript
window.__TAURI_ISOLATION_HOOK__ = (payload) => {
  // let's not verify or modify anything, just print the content from the hook
  console.log('hook', payload);
  return payload;
};
```

Now, all we need to do is set up our `tauri.conf.json` [configuration](#configuration) to use the Isolation pattern, and have just bootstrapped to the Isolation pattern from the [Brownfield pattern].

## Configuration

Let's assume that our main frontend `frontendDist` is set to `../dist`. We also output our Isolation application to `../dist-isolation`.

```json
{
  "build": {
    "frontendDist": "../dist"
  },
  "app": {
    "security": {
      "pattern": {
        "use": "isolation",
        "options": {
          "dir": "../dist-isolation"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Process Model

Tauri employs a multi-process architecture similar to Electron or many modern web browsers. This guide explores the reasons behind the design choice and why it is key to writing secure applications.

## Why Multiple Processes?

In the early days of GUI applications, it was common to use a single process to perform computation, draw the interface and react to user input. As you can probably guess, this meant that a long-running, expensive computation would leave the user interface unresponsive, or worse, a failure in one app component would bring the whole app crashing down.

It became clear that a more resilient architecture was needed, and applications began running different components in different processes. This makes much better use of modern multi-core CPUs and creates far safer applications. A crash in one component doesn't affect the whole system anymore, as components are isolated on different processes. If a process gets into an invalid state, we can easily restart it.

We can also limit the blast radius of potential exploits by handing out only the minimum amount of permissions to each process, just enough so they can get their job done. This pattern is known as the [Principle of Least Privilege], and you see it in the real world all the time. If you have a gardener coming over to trim your hedge, you give them the key to your garden. You would **not** give them the keys to your house; why would they need access to that? The same concept applies to computer programs. The less access we give them, the less harm they can do if they get compromised.

## The Core Process

Each Tauri application has a core process, which acts as the application's entry point and which is the only component with full access to the operating system.

The Core's primary responsibility is to use that access to create and orchestrate application windows, system-tray menus, or notifications. Tauri implements the necessary cross-platform abstractions to make this easy. It also routes all [Inter-Process Communication] through the Core process, allowing you to intercept, filter, and manipulate IPC messages in one central place.

The Core process should also be responsible for managing global state, such as settings or database connections. This allows you to easily synchronize state between windows and protect your business-sensitive data from prying eyes in the Frontend.

We chose Rust to implement Tauri because of its concept of [Ownership]
guarantees memory safety while retaining excellent performance.

"Events & Commands 3" -> WebView3{style.animated: true}
```

<figcaption>Simplified representation of the Tauri process model. A single Core process manages one or more WebView processes.</figcaption>
</figure>

## The WebView Process

The Core process doesn't render the actual user interface (UI) itself; it spins up WebView processes that leverage WebView libraries provided by the operating system. A WebView is a browser-like environment that executes your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This means that most of your techniques and tools used in traditional web development can be used to create Tauri applications. For example, many Tauri examples are written using the [Svelte] frontend framework and the [Vite] bundler.

Security best practices apply as well; for example, you must always sanitize user input, never handle secrets in the Frontend, and ideally defer as much business logic as possible to the Core process to keep your attack surface small.

Unlike other similar solutions, the WebView libraries are **not** included in your final executable but dynamically linked at runtime[^1]. This makes your application _significantly_ smaller, but it also means that you need to keep platform differences in mind, just like traditional web development.

# App Size

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

While Tauri by default provides very small binaries it doesn't hurt to push the limits a bit, so here are some tips and tricks for reaching optimal results.

## Cargo Configuration

One of the simplest frontend agnostic size improvements you can do to your project is adding a Cargo profile to it.

Dependent on whether you use the stable or nightly Rust toolchain the options available to you differ a bit. It's recommended you stick to the stable toolchain unless you're an advanced user.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Stable">
```toml
# src-tauri/Cargo.toml
[profile.dev]
incremental = true # Compile your binary in smaller steps.

[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1 # Allows LLVM to perform better optimization.
lto = true # Enables link-time-optimizations.
opt-level = "s" # Prioritizes small binary size. Use `3` if you prefer speed.
panic = "abort" # Higher performance by disabling panic handlers.
strip = true # Ensures debug symbols are removed.

````
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Nightly">
```toml
# src-tauri/Cargo.toml
[profile.dev]
incremental = true # Compile your binary in smaller steps.
rustflags = ["-Zthreads=8"] # Better compile performance.

[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1 # Allows LLVM to perform better optimization.
lto = true # Enables link-time-optimizations.
opt-level = "s" # Prioritizes small binary size. Use `3` if you prefer speed.
panic = "abort" # Higher performance by disabling panic handlers.
strip = true # Ensures debug symbols are removed.
trim-paths = "all" # Removes potentially privileged information from your binaries.
rustflags = ["-Cdebuginfo=0", "-Zthreads=8"] # Better compile performance.
````

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Remove Unused Commands

In Pull Request [`feat: add a new option to remove unused commands`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/12890), we added in a new option in the tauri config file

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "build": {
    "removeUnusedCommands": true
  }
}
```

to remove commands that're never allowed in your capability files (ACL), so you don't have to pay for what you don't use

:::tip
To maximize the benefit of this, only include commands that you use in the ACL instead of using `defaults`s
:::

:::note
This feature requires `tauri@2.4`, `tauri-build@2.1`, `tauri-plugin@2.1` and `tauri-cli@2.4`
:::

:::note
This won't be accounting for dynamically added ACLs at runtime so make sure to check it when using this
:::

<details>
<summary>How does it work under the hood?</summary>

`tauri-cli` will communicate with `tauri-build` and the build script of `tauri`, `tauri-plugin` through an environment variable
and let them generate a list of allowed commands from the ACL,
this will then be used by the `generate_handler` macro to remove unused commands based on that

An internal detail is this environment variable is currently `REMOVE_UNUSED_COMMANDS`,
and it's set to project's directory, usually the `src-tauri` directory, this is used for the build scripts to find the capability files,
and although it's not encouraged, you can still set this environment variable yourself if you can't or don't want to use `tauri-cli` to get this to work
(**do note that as this is an implementation detail, we don't guarantee the stability of it**)

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page is designed to explain the high-level concepts and security features
at the core of Tauri's design and ecosystem that make you, your applications and your users more secure by default.

It also includes advice on best practices, how to report vulnerabilities to us
and references to detailed concept explanations.

:::note

It is important to remember that the security of your Tauri application is the sum
of the overall security of Tauri itself, all Rust and npm dependencies,
your code, and the devices that run the final application.
The Tauri team does its best to do their part, the security community does its part
and you should also follow some important best practices.

:::

## Trust Boundaries

> Trust boundary is a term used in computer science and security which describes
> a boundary where program data or execution changes its level of "trust,"
> or where two principals with different capabilities exchange data or commands.
> [^wikipedia-trust-boundary]

[^wikipedia-trust-boundary]: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_boundary).

Tauri's security model differentiates between Rust code written for the application's
core and frontend code written in any framework or language understood by the system
WebView.

Inspecting and strongly defining all data passed between boundaries is
very important to prevent trust boundary violations.
If data is passed without access control between these boundaries then
it's easy for attackers to elevate and abuse privileges.

The [IPC layer](/concept/inter-process-communication/) is the bridge for communication between these two trust
groups and ensures that boundaries are not broken.

![IPC Diagram](@assets/security/tauri-trust-boundaries.svg)

Any code executed by the plugins or the application core has full
access to all available system resources and is not constrained.

Any code executed in the WebView has only access to exposed system resources via the well-defined IPC layer.
Access to core application commands is configured and restricted by capabilities defined in the application configuration.
The individual command implementations enforce the optional fine-grained access levels also defined
in the capabilities configuration.

</CardGrid>

Tauri allows developers to choose their own frontend stack and framework.
This means that we cannot provide a hardening guide for every frontend stack of
of choice, but Tauri provides generic features to control and contain the attack surface.

    title="Isolation Pattern"
    href="/concept/inter-process-communication/isolation/"
  />
</CardGrid>

## (Not) Bundling WebViews

Tauri's approach is to rely on the operating system WebView and not bundling
the WebView into the application binary.

This has a multitide of reasons but from a security perspective the most
important reason is the average time it takes from publication of a
security patched version of a WebView to being rolled out to the
application end user.

![IPC Diagram](@assets/security/tauri-update-lag.svg)

We have observed that WebView packet maintainer and operating system packet maintainers
are in average significantly faster to patch and roll out security patched
Webview releases than application developers who bundle the WebView directly
with their application.

There are exceptions from this observation and in theory both paths can be
taken in a similar time frame but this involves a larger overhead infrastructure
for each application.

Bundling has it's drawbacks from a Tauri application developer experience and
we do not think it is inherently insecure but the current design is a trade off
that significantly reduces known vulnerabilities in the wild.

## Ecosystem

The Tauri organization provides and maintains more than just the Tauri
repository, and to ensure we provide a reasonable secure
multi platform application framework, we make sure to go some extra miles.

To learn more about how we secure our development process,
what you could adapt and implement, what known threats your application
can face and what we plan to improve or harden in the future, you
can check out the following documents:

## Coordinated Disclosure

If you feel that there is a security concern or issue with anything in Tauri
or other repositories in our organization, **please do not publicly comment on your findings**.
Instead, reach out directly to our security team.

The preferred disclosure method is via [Github Vulnerability Disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
on the affected repository.
Most of our repositories have this feature enabled but if in doubt please submit via the [Tauri repository](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/new).

Alternatively you can contact us via email at: [security@tauri.app](mailto:security@tauri.app).

Although we do not currently have a budget for security bounties,
in some cases, we will consider rewarding coordinated disclosure with our limited resources.

# Capabilities

Tauri provides application and plugin developers with a capabilities system,
to granually enable and constrain the core exposure to the application frontend running in the
system WebView.

Capabilities define which [permissions](/security/permissions/)
are granted or denied for which windows or webviews.

Capabilities can affect multiple windows and webviews and these can be
referenced in multiple capabilities.

:::tip[Security Tip]

Windows and WebViews which are part of more than one capability
effectively merge the security boundaries and permissions of all
involved capabilities.

:::

Capability files are either defined as a JSON or a TOML file
inside the `src-tauri/capabilities` directory.

It is good practice to use individual files and only reference
them by identifier in the `tauri.conf.json` but it is also possible
to define them directly in the `capabilities` field.

All capabilities inside the `capabilities` directory are automatically enabled
by default.
Once capabilities are explicitly enabled in the `tauri.conf.json`,
only these are used in the application build.

For a full reference of the configuration scheme please see the
[references](/reference/config/) section.

The following example JSON defines a capability that allows the main window
use the default functionality of core plugins and the `window.setTitle` API.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json"
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "main-capability",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    "core:path:default",
    "core:event:default",
    "core:window:default",
    "core:app:default",
    "core:resources:default",
    "core:menu:default",
    "core:tray:default",
    "core:window:allow-set-title"
  ]
}
```

These snippets are part of the
[Tauri configuration](/develop/configuration-files/#tauri-config) file.

This is likely the most common configuration method,
where the individual capabilities are inlined and only
permissions are referenced by identifier.

This requires well defined
capability files in the `capabilities` directory.

```json title=src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
  "app": {
    "security": {
      "capabilities": ["my-capability", "main-capability"]
    }
  }
}
```

Inline capabilities can be mixed with pre-defined capabilities.

```json title=src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
  "app": {
    "security": {
      "capabilities": [
        {
          "identifier": "my-capability",
          "description": "My application capability used for all windows",
          "windows": ["*"],
          "permissions": ["fs:default", "allow-home-read-extended"]
        },
        "my-second-capability"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

By default, all commands that you registered in your app
(using the
[`tauri::Builder::.invoke_handler`](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/struct.Builder.html#method.invoke_handler)
function)
are allowed to be used by all the windows and webviews of the app.
To change that, consider using
[`AppManifest::commands`](https://docs.rs/tauri-build/2.0.0/tauri_build/struct.AppManifest.html#method.commands).

```rust title=src-tauri/build.rs
fn main() {
    tauri_build::try_build(
        tauri_build::Attributes::new()
            .app_manifest(tauri_build::AppManifest::new().commands(&["your_command"])),
    )
    .unwrap();
}
```

## Target Platform

Capabilities can be platform-specific by defining the `platforms` array.
By default the capability is applied to all targets,
but you can select a subset of the `linux`, `macOS`, `windows`, `iOS` and `android` targets.

For example a capability for desktop operating systems.
Note it enables permissions on plugins that are only available on desktop:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/desktop.json"
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "desktop-capability",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "platforms": ["linux", "macOS", "windows"],
  "permissions": ["global-shortcut:allow-register"]
}
```

And another example of a capability for mobile.
Note it enables permissions on plugins that are only available on mobile:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/mobile.json"
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/mobile-schema.json",
  "identifier": "mobile-capability",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "platforms": ["iOS", "android"],
  "permissions": [
    "nfc:allow-scan",
    "biometric:allow-authenticate",
    "barcode-scanner:allow-scan"
  ]
}
```

## Remote API Access

By default the API is only accessible to bundled code shipped with the Tauri App.
To allow remote sources access to certain Tauri Commands it is possible to define this in
the capability configuration file.

This example would allow to scan for NFC tags and to use the barcode scanner from
all subdomains of `tauri.app`.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/remote-tags.json"
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/remote-schema.json",
  "identifier": "remote-tag-capability",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "remote": {
    "urls": ["https://*.tauri.app"]
  },
  "platforms": ["iOS", "android"],
  "permissions": ["nfc:allow-scan", "barcode-scanner:allow-scan"]
}
```

:::caution

On Linux and Android, Tauri is unable to distinguish between requests from an embedded `<iframe>` and the window itself.

Please consider usage of this feature very carefully and read more into the specific
security implications for your targeted operating system in the reference section of this feature.

:::

## Security Boundaries

_What does it protect against?_

Depending on the permissions and capabilities it is able to:

- Minimize impact of frontend compromise
- Prevent or reduce (accidential) exposure of local system interfaces and data
- Prevent or reduce possible privilege escalation from frontend to backend/system

_What does it **not** protect against?_

- Malicious or insecure Rust code
- Too lax scopes and configuration
- Incorrect scope checks in the command implementation
- Intentional bypasses from Rust code
- Basically anything which was written in the rust core of an application
- 0-days or unpatched 1-days in the system WebView
- Supply chain attacks or otherwise compromised developer systems

:::tip[Security Tip]

The security boundaries are depending on window labels (**not titles**).
We recommend to only expose of the window creation functionality
to higher privileged windows.

:::

## Schema Files

Tauri generates JSON schemas with all the permissions available to
your application, allowing autocompletion in your IDE.
To use a schema, set the `$schema` property in your configuration file
(either .json or .toml) to one of the platform-specific schemas
located in the `gen/schemas` directory. Usually
you will set it to `../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json` or
`../gen/schemas/mobile-schema.json` though you can also define a capability
for a specific target platform.

## Configuration Files

Simplified example of an example Tauri application directory structure:

```sh
tauri-app
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── src
├── src-tauri
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── capabilities
│      └── <identifier>.json/toml
│   ├── src
│   ├── tauri.conf.json
```

Everything can be inlined into the `tauri.conf.json` but even a
little more advanced configuration would bloat this file and
the goal of this approach is that the permissions are abstracted
away whenever possible and simple to understand.

## Core Permissions

A list of all core permissions can be found on the [Core Permissions](/reference/acl/core-permissions/) page.

# Content Security Policy (CSP)

Tauri restricts the [Content Security Policy] (CSP) of your HTML pages.
This can be used to reduce or prevent impact of common web based vulnerabilities
like cross-site-scripting (XSS).

Local scripts are hashed, styles and external scripts are referenced using a cryptographic nonce,
which prevents unallowed content from being loaded.

:::caution
Avoid loading remote content such as scripts served over a CDN as they introduce an attack vector.
In general any untrusted file can introduce new and subtle attack vectors.
:::

The CSP protection is only enabled if set on the Tauri configuration file.
You should make it as restricted as possible, only allowing the webview to load assets
from hosts you trust, and preferably own.
At compile time, Tauri appends its nonces and hashes to the relevant CSP attributes automatically
to bundled code and assets, so you only need to worry about what is unique to your application.

This is an example CSP configuration taken from the [`api`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/examples/api/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json#L22)
example of Tauri, but every application developer needs to tailor this to their own application needs.

```json title="tauri/examples/api/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
  "csp": {
        "default-src": "'self' customprotocol: asset:",
        "connect-src": "ipc: http://ipc.localhost",
        "font-src": ["https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
        "img-src": "'self' asset: http://asset.localhost blob: data:",
        "style-src": "'unsafe-inline' 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com"
      },
```

:::tip
When using Rust to develop your frontend, or if your frontend otherwise uses WebAssembly, remember
to include `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` as a `script-src`.

# Tauri Ecosystem Security

Our Tauri organization ecosystem is hosted on GitHub and facilitates several
features to make our repositories more resilient against adversaries targeting
our source code and releases.

To reduce risk and to comply with commonly adopted best practices we have the following methods
in place.

### Build Pipelines

The process of releasing our source-code artifacts is highly automated
in GitHub build pipelines using GitHub actions, yet mandates kickoff and review from real humans.

### Signed Commits

Our core repositores require signed commits to reduce risk of impersonation and
to allow identification of attributed commits after detection of possible compromise.

### Code Review

All Pull Requests (PRs) merged into our repositories need approval from at least one maintainer of the
project, which in most cases is the working group.
Code is generally reviewed in PRs and default security workflows and checks are run to ensure
the code adheres to common standards.

### Release Process

Our working group reviews code changes, tags PRs with scope, and makes sure that everything stays up to date.
We strive to internally audit all security relevant PRs before publishing minor and major releases.

And when its time to publish a new version, one of the maintainers tags a new release on dev, which:

- Validates core
- Runs tests
- Audits security for crates and npm
- Generates changelogs
- Creates artifacts
- Creates a draft release

Then the maintainer reviews the release notes, edits if necessary, and a new release is forged.

# Future Work

This section describes topics we started or would like to tackle
in the future to make Tauri apps even more secure.
If you feel interested in these topics or have pre-existing
knowledge we are always happy to welcome new contributors
and advice via GitHub or other community platforms like Discord.

### Binary Analysis

To allow pentesters, auditors and automated security checks
do to their job properly it is very valuable to provide insight even from
compiled binaries. Not all companies are open source or provide source code
for audits, red-teams and other security testing.

Another often overlooked point is that providing inbuilt metadata empowers
users of your application to audit their systems for known vulnerabilities
at scale without dedicating their lifetime and efforts into it.

If your threatmodel depends on security by obscurity this section will be
providing some tools and points which hopefully will make you reconsider.

For Rust there is `cargo-auditable` to create [SBOMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain)
and provide exact crate versions and dependencies of a binary without breaking reproducible builds.

For the frontend stack we are not aware of similar solutions, so extracting
the frontend assets from the binary should be a straightforward process.
Afterwards it should be possible to use tooling like `npm audit` or similar.
There are already [blog posts](https://infosecwriteups.com/reverse-engineering-a-native-desktop-application-tauri-app-5a2d92772da5)
about the process but no simple tooling is available.

We are planning to provide such tooling or make it easier to extract assets,
when compiling a Tauri app with certain features.

To use pentesting tools like [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp),
[Zap](https://www.zaproxy.org/) or [Caido](https://caido.io/) it is necessary
to intercept traffic from the webview and pass it through the testing proxy.
Currently Tauri has no inbuilt method to do so but there is ongoing work to
ease this process.

All of these tools allow to properly test and inspect Tauri applications
without source code access and should be considered when building a Tauri application.

We are planning to further support and implement related features in the future.

### WebView Hardening

In Tauri's current threat model and boundaries we are not able to add more
security constraints to the WebView itself and since it is the biggest part of
our stack which is written in an memory unsafe language, we are planning to research and
consider ways to further sandbox and isolate the webview processes.

Inbuilt and external sandboxing methods will be evaluated to reduce attack impact
and to enforce the IPC bridge for system access.
We believe that this part of our stack is the weak link but current generation WebViews
are improving in their hardening and exploit resilience.

### Fuzzing

To allow more efficient and simplify the process of fuzzing Tauri applications
we aim to further implement our mock runtimes and other tooling to make it easier
to configure and build for individual Tauri applications.

Tauri is supporting a multitude of Operating Systems and CPU architectures, usually
apps have only few or no possible memory unsafe code.
No pre-existing fuzzing tooling and libraries support these uncommon fuzzing use case,
so we need to implement it and support existing libraries like [libAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL)
to build Tauri fuzzing frameworks.

The goal is to make fuzzing accessible and efficient for Tauri application developers.

# HTTP Headers

import SinceVersion from '../../../components/SinceVersion.astro';

<SinceVersion version="2.1.0" />

A header defined in the configuration gets sent along the responses to the webview.
This doesn't include IPC messages and error responses.
To be more specific, every response sent via the `get_response` function in
<a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/8e8312bb8201ccc609e4bbc1a990bdc314daa00f/crates/tauri/src/protocol/tauri.rs#L103" target="_blank">crates/tauri/src/protocol/tauri.rs ↗</a>
will include those headers.

### Header Names

The header names are limited to:

:::note
`Tauri-Custom-Header` is not intended for production use.
:::

:::note
<a href="../csp/">The Content-Security-Policy (CSP)</a> is not defined here.
:::

### How to Configure Headers

- with a string
- with an array of strings
- with an object/key-value, where the values must be strings
- with null

The header values are always converted to strings for the actual response. Depending on how the configuration file looks, some header values need to be composed.
Those are the rules on how a composite gets created:

- `string`: stays the same for the resulting header value
- `array`: items are joined by `, `  for the resulting header value
- `key-value`: items are composed from: key + space + value. Items are then joined by `; `  for the resulting header value
- `null`: header will be ignored

### Example

```javascript title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
{
 //...
  "app":{
    //...
    "security": {
      //...
      "headers": {
        "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
        "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
        "Timing-Allow-Origin": [
          "https://developer.mozilla.org",
          "https://example.com",
        ],
        "X-Content-Type-Options": null, // gets ignored
        "Access-Control-Expose-Headers": "Tauri-Custom-Header",
        "Tauri-Custom-Header": {
          "key1": "'value1' 'value2'",
          "key2": "'value3'"
        }
      },
      // notice how the CSP is not defined under headers
      "csp": "default-src 'self'; connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost",
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
`Tauri-Custom-Header` is not intended for production use.
For Tests: Remember to set `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` accordingly.
:::

In this example `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` are set to
allow for the use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer" target="_blank">`SharedArrayBuffer ↗`</a>.
`Timing-Allow-Origin` grants scripts loaded from the listed websites to access detailed network timing data via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing" target="_blank">Resource Timing API ↗</a>.

For the helloworld example, this config results in:

```http
access-control-allow-origin:  http://tauri.localhost
access-control-expose-headers: Tauri-Custom-Header
content-security-policy: default-src 'self'; connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost; script-src 'self' 'sha256-Wjjrs6qinmnr+tOry8x8PPwI77eGpUFR3EEGZktjJNs='
content-type: text/html
cross-origin-embedder-policy: require-corp
cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin
tauri-custom-header: key1 'value1' 'value2'; key2 'value3'
timing-allow-origin: https://developer.mozilla.org, https://example.com
```

### Frameworks

Some development environments require extra settings, to emulate the production environment.

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

For setups running the build tool **Vite** (those include **Qwik, React, Solid, Svelte, and Vue**) add the wanted headers to `vite.config.ts`. 
```typescript title=vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
      // ...
      headers: {
        'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
        'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
        'Timing-Allow-Origin': 'https://developer.mozilla.org, https://example.com',
        'Access-Control-Expose-Headers': 'Tauri-Custom-Header',
        'Tauri-Custom-Header': "key1 'value1' 'value2'; key2 'value3'"
      },
    },
})
```
Sometimes the `vite.config.ts` is integrated into the frameworks configuration file, but the setup stays the same.
In case of **Angular** add them to `angular.json`.
```json title=angular.json
{
  //...
  "projects":{
    //...
    "insert-project-name":{
      //...
      "architect":{
        //...
        "serve":{
          //...
          "options":{
            //...
            "headers":{
              "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
              "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
              "Timing-Allow-Origin": "https://developer.mozilla.org, https://example.com",
              "Access-Control-Expose-Headers": "Tauri-Custom-Header",
              "Tauri-Custom-Header": "key1 'value1' 'value2'; key2 'value3'"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
And in case of **Nuxt** to `nuxt.config.ts`.
```typescript title=nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  //...
  vite: {
    //...
    server: {
      //...
      headers:{
        'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
        'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
        'Timing-Allow-Origin': 'https://developer.mozilla.org, https://example.com',
        'Access-Control-Expose-Headers': 'Tauri-Custom-Header',
        'Tauri-Custom-Header': "key1 'value1' 'value2'; key2 'value3'"
      }
    },
  },
});
```
**Next.js** doesn't rely on **Vite**, so the approach is different.
Read more about it <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/headers" target="_blank">here ↗</a>.
The headers are defined in `next.config.js`.
```javascript title=next.config.js
module.exports = {
  //...
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy',
            value: 'same-origin',
          },
          {
            key: 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy',
            value: 'require-corp',
          },
          {
            key: 'Timing-Allow-Origin',
            value: 'https://developer.mozilla.org, https://example.com',
          },
          {
            key: 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers',
            value: 'Tauri-Custom-Header',
          },
          {
            key: 'Tauri-Custom-Header',
            value: "key1 'value1' 'value2'; key2 'value3'",
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  },
}
```


#### Rust

For **Yew** and **Leptos** add the headers to `Trunk.toml`

```toml title=Trunk.toml
#...
[serve]
#...
headers = { 
  "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy" = "same-origin",
  "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy" = "require-corp",
  "Timing-Allow-Origin" = "https://developer.mozilla.org, https://example.com",
  "Access-Control-Expose-Headers" = "Tauri-Custom-Header",
  "Tauri-Custom-Header" = "key1 'value1' 'value2'; key2 'value3'"
}

```

# Application Lifecycle Threats

Tauri applications are composed of many pieces at different points in time of the application lifecycle.
Here we describe classical threats and what you SHOULD do about them.

All of these distinct steps are described in the following sections.

![Threat Stages During Development](@assets/concept/application-flow-simple.svg)

:::note
The weakest link in your application lifecycle essentially defines your security.
Each step can compromise the assumptions and integrity of all subsequent steps,
so it is important to see the whole picture at all times.
:::

## Upstream Threats

Tauri is a direct dependency on your project, and we maintain strict authorial control
of commits, reviews, pull requests, and releases.
We do our best to maintain up-to-date dependencies and take action to either update
or fork and fix. Other projects may not be so well maintained, and may not even
have ever been audited.

Please consider their health when integrating them, otherwise, you may have adopted
architectural debt without even knowing it.

### Keep Your Applications Up-To-Date

When releasing your app into the wild, you are also shipping a bundle that has Tauri in it.
Vulnerabilities affecting Tauri may impact the security of your application.
By updating Tauri to the latest version, you ensure that critical vulnerabilities
are already patched and cannot be exploited in your application.
Also be sure to keep your compiler (`rustc`) and transpilers (`nodejs`) up to date,
because there are often security issues that are resolved.
This also is true for your development system in general.

### Evaluate Your Dependencies

While NPM and Crates.io provide many convenient packages,
it is your responsibility to choose trustworthy third-party libraries - or
rewrite them in Rust. If you do use outdated libraries which are affected by
known vulnerabilities or are unmaintained, your application security and good
night's sleep could be in jeopardy.

Use tooling like [`npm audit`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-audit)
and [`cargo audit`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit) to automate this process,
and lean on the security community's important work.

Recent trends in the rust ecosystem like [`cargo-vet`](https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet)
or [`cargo crev`](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev) can
help to further reduce likelihood of supply chain attacks.
To find out on whose shoulders you stand, you can use the [`cargo supply chain`](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-supply-chain)
tool.

One practice that we highly recommend, is to only ever consume critical dependencies
from git using hash revisions at best or named tags as second best.
This holds for Rust as well as the Node ecosystem.

## Development Threats

We assume that you, the developer, care for your development environment.
It is on you to make sure that your operating system, build toolchains, and
associated dependencies are kept up to date and reasonable secured.

A genuine risk all of us face is what is known as "supply-chain attacks",
which are usually considered to be attacks on direct dependencies of your project.
However, a growing class of attacks in the wild directly target development machines,
and you would be well off to address this head-on.

### Development Server

Tauri application frontends can be developed using a number of web frameworks.
Each of these frameworks usually ship their own development server, which is exposing
the frontend assets via an open port to the local system or network.
This allows the frontend to be hot-reloaded and debugged in the WebView or Browser.

In practice this connection is often neither encrypted nor authenticated by default.
This is also the case for the built-in Tauri development server and exposes your
frontend and assets to the local network. Additionally, this allows attackers
to push their own frontend code to development devices in the same network as the attacker.
Depending on what kind of functionality is exposed this could lead to device compromise
in the worst case.

You should only develop on trusted networks where you can safely expose your
development device. If this is not possible you MUST ensure that your development
server uses **mutual** authentication and encryption (e.g. mTLS) for connections
with your development devices.

:::note
The built-in Tauri development server does not support
mutual authentication and transport encryption at the moment and should not be used on untrusted networks.
:::

### Harden Development machines

Hardening your development systems depends on various factors and on your personal
threat model but some generic advice we recommend to follow:

- Never use administrative accounts for day to day tasks like coding
- Never use production secrets on development machines
- Prevent secrets to be checked into source code version control
- Use security hardware tokens or similar to reduce impact of compromised systems
- Keep your system up to date
- Keep your installed applications to a minimum

A more practical collection of procedures can be found
in an [awesome security hardening collection](https://github.com/decalage2/awesome-security-hardening).

You can of course virtualise your development environment to keep attackers at bay,
but this won't protect you from attacks that target your project rather than just your machine.

### Ensure Source Control Authentication and Authorization

If you are working like the majority of developers, using source code version control tools and
service providers is an essential step during development.

To ensure that your source code can not be modified by unauthorized actors it is important
to understand and correctly set up up access control for your source code version control system.

Also, consider requiring all (regular) contributors to sign their commits to prevent situations where malicious
commits are attributed to non-compromised or non-maliocious contributors.

## Buildtime Threats

Modern organizations use CI/CD to manufacture binary artifacts.

You need to be able to fully trust these remote (and third party owned) systems,
as they have access to source code, secrets and are able to modify builds without
you being able to verifiably prove that the produced binaries are the same as your local code.
This means either you trust a reputable provider or host these systems on your own and controlled
hardware.

At Tauri, we provide a GitHub Workflow for building on multiple platforms.
If you create your own CI/CD and depend on third-party tooling, be wary of actions
whose versions you have not explicitly pinned.

You should sign your binaries for the platform you are shipping to.
While this can be complicated and somewhat costly to set up, end users expect that your
app is verifiably from you.

If cryptographic secrets are properly stored on hardware tokens,
a compromised build system won't be able to leak involved signing keys,
but could use them to sign malicious releases.

### Reproducible Builds

To combat backdoor injection at build time, you need your builds to be reproducible,
so that you can verify that the build assets are exactly the same when you build them
locally or on another independent provider.

The first problem is that Rust is by default not fully **reliably** producing reproducible
builds. It supports this in theory, but there are still bugs, and it recently broke on a release.

You can keep track of the current state in the rust project's
[public bug tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-reproducibility).

The next problem you will encounter is that many common frontend bundlers do not produce
reproducible output either, so the bundled assets may also break reproducible builds.

This means that you cannot fully rely on reproducible builds by default, and
sadly need to fully trust your build systems.

## Distribution Threats

We have done our best to make shipping hot updates to the app as
straightforward and secure as possible.
However, all bets are off if you lose control of the manifest server,
the build server, or the binary hosting service.

If you build your own system, consult a professional OPS architect and build it properly.

If you are looking for another trusted distribution solution for Tauri apps
our partner CrabNebula has an offering: [https://crabnebula.dev/cloud](https://crabnebula.dev/cloud)

## Runtime Threats

We assume the webview is insecure, which has led Tauri to implement several protections
regarding webview access to system APIs in the context of loading untrusted userland content.

Using the [Content Security Policy](/security/csp/) will lockdown types of
communication that the Webview can undertake.
Furthermore, [Capabilities](/security/capabilities/) can prevent untrusted content or scripts from accessing
the API within the Webview.

We also recommend to setup an easy and secure way to report vulnerabilities similar to
[our process](/security/#coordinated-disclosure).

# Permissions

Permissions are descriptions of explicit privileges of commands.

```toml
[[permission]]
identifier = "my-identifier"
description = "This describes the impact and more."
commands.allow = [
    "read_file"
]

[[scope.allow]]
my-scope = "$HOME/*"

[[scope.deny]]
my-scope = "$HOME/secret"
```

It can enable commands to be accessible in the frontend of a Tauri application.
It can map scopes to commands and defines which commands are enabled.
Permissions can enable or deny certain commands, define scopes or combine both.

To grant or deny a permission to your app's window or webview,
you must reference the permission in a [capability](/security/capabilities/).

Permissions can be grouped as a set under a new identifier.
This is called a permission set. This allows you to combine scope related permissions
with command related permissions. It also allows to group or bundle operating
specific permissions into more usable sets.

As a plugin developer you can ship multiple, pre-defined, well named permissions
for all of your exposed commands.

As an application developer you can extend existing plugin permissions or
define them for your own commands.
They can be grouped or extended in a set to be re-used or to simplify the main
configuration files later.

## Permission Identifier

The permissions identifier is used to ensure that permissions can be re-used and have unique names.

:::tip

With **name** we refer to the plugin crate name without the `tauri-plugin-` prefix.
This is meant as namespacing to reduce likelihood of naming conflicts.
When referencing permissions of the application itself it is not necessary.

:::

- `<name>:default` Indicates the permission is the default for a plugin or application
- `<name>:<command-name>` Indicates the permission is for an individual command

The plugin prefix `tauri-plugin-` will be automatically prepended to the identifier of plugins
at compile time and is not required to be manually specified.

Identifiers are limited to ASCII lower case alphabetic characters `[a-z]` and the maximum length
of the identifier is currently limited to `116` due to the following constants:

```rust
const IDENTIFIER_SEPARATOR: u8 = b':';
const PLUGIN_PREFIX: &str = "tauri-plugin-";

// https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-name-field
const MAX_LEN_PREFIX: usize = 64 - PLUGIN_PREFIX.len();
const MAX_LEN_BASE: usize = 64;
const MAX_LEN_IDENTIFIER: usize = MAX_LEN_PREFIX + 1 + MAX_LEN_BASE;
```

## Configuration Files

Simplified example of an example Tauri **plugin** directory structure:

```sh
tauri-plugin
├── README.md
├── src
│  └── lib.rs
├── build.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── permissions
│  └── <identifier>.json/toml
│  └── default.json/toml
```

The default permission is handled in a special way,
as it is automatically added to the application
configuration, as long as the Tauri CLI is used to
add plugins to a Tauri application.

For **application** developers the structure is similar:

```sh
tauri-app
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── src
├── src-tauri
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── permissions
│      └── <identifier>.toml
|   ├── capabilities
│      └── <identifier>.json/.toml
│   ├── src
│   ├── tauri.conf.json
```

:::note

As an application developer the capability files can be written in `json`/`json5` or `toml`,
whereas permissions only can be defined in `toml`.

:::

## Examples

Example permissions from the `File System` plugin.

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/autogenerated/base-directories/home.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "scope-home"
description = """This scope permits access to all files and
list content of top level directories in the `$HOME`folder."""

[[scope.allow]]
path = "$HOME/*"
```

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/read-files.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "read-files"
description = """This enables all file read related
commands without any pre-configured accessible paths."""
commands.allow = [
    "read_file",
    "read",
    "open",
    "read_text_file",
    "read_text_file_lines",
    "read_text_file_lines_next"
]
```

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/autogenerated/commands/mkdir.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "allow-mkdir"
description = "This enables the mkdir command."
commands.allow = [
    "mkdir"
]
```

Example implementation extending above plugin permissions in your app:

```toml title="my-app/src-tauri/permissions/home-read-extends.toml"
[[set]]
identifier = "allow-home-read-extended"
description = """ This allows non-recursive read access to files and to create directories
in the `$HOME` folder.
"""
permissions = [
    "fs:read-files",
    "fs:scope-home",
    "fs:allow-mkdir"
]
```

# Runtime Authority

The runtime authority is part of the Tauri Core.
It holds all permissions, capabilities and scopes at runtime to enforce
which window can access which command and passes scopes to commands.

Whenever a Tauri command is invoked from the webview the runtime authority
receives the invoke request, makes sure that the origin is allowed to actually
use the requested command, checks if the origin is part of capabilities and
if scopes are defined for the command and applicable then they are injected into
the invoke request, which is then passed to the proper Tauri command.

If the origin is not allowed to call the command, the runtime authority will deny
the request and the Tauri command is never invoked.

![IPC Diagram](@assets/concept/runtime-authority.svg)

# Command Scopes

A scope is a granular way to define (dis)allowed behavior of a Tauri command.

Scopes are categorized into `allow` or `deny` scopes, where `deny` always
supersedes the `allow` scope.

The scope type needs be of any [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/) serializable type.
These types are plugin-specific in general. For scoped commands implemented in a Tauri application
the scope type needs to be defined in the application and then enforced in the command implementation.

For instance, the [`Fs`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v2/plugins/fs) plugin allows you to use scopes to allow or deny certain directories and files
and the [`http`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v2/plugins/http) plugin uses scopes to filter URLs that are allowed to be reached.

The scope is passed to the command and handling or properly enforcing is implemented
by the command itself.

:::caution

Command developers need to ensure that there are no scope bypasses possible.
The scope validation implementation should be audited to ensure correctness.

:::

## Examples

These examples are taken from the [`Fs`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v2/plugins/fs) plugin permissions:

The scope type in this plugin for all commands is a string,
which contains a [`glob`](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/) compatible path.

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/autogenerated/base-directories/applocaldata.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "scope-applocaldata-recursive"
description = '''
This scope recursive access to the complete `$APPLOCALDATA` folder,
including sub directories and files.
'''

[[permission.scope.allow]]
path = "$APPLOCALDATA/**"
```

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/deny-webview-data.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "deny-webview-data-linux"
description = '''
This denies read access to the
`$APPLOCALDATA` folder on linux as the webview data and
configuration values are stored here.
Allowing access can lead to sensitive information disclosure and
should be well considered.
'''
platforms = ["linux"]

[[scope.deny]]
path = "$APPLOCALDATA/**"

[[permission]]
identifier = "deny-webview-data-windows"
description = '''
This denies read access to the
`$APPLOCALDATA/EBWebView` folder on windows as the webview data and
configuration values are stored here.
Allowing access can lead to sensitive information disclosure and
should be well considered.
'''
platforms = ["windows"]

[[scope.deny]]
path = "$APPLOCALDATA/EBWebView/**"
```

The above scopes can be used to allow access to the `APPLOCALDATA` folder, while
preventing access to the `EBWebView` subfolder on windows, which contains sensitive webview data.

These can merged into a set, which reduces duplicate configuration and makes it more
understandable for anyone looking into the application configuration.

First the deny scopes are merged into `deny-default`:

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/deny-default.toml"
[[set]]
identifier = "deny-default"
description = '''
This denies access to dangerous Tauri relevant files and
folders by default.
'''
permissions = ["deny-webview-data-linux", "deny-webview-data-windows"]
```

Afterwards deny and allow scopes are merged:

```toml
[[set]]
identifier = "scope-applocaldata-reasonable"
description = '''
This scope set allows access to the `APPLOCALDATA` folder and
subfolders except for linux,
while it denies access to dangerous Tauri relevant files and
folders by default on windows.
'''
permissions = ["scope-applocaldata-recursive", "deny-default"]
```

These scopes can be either used for all commands, by extending the global scope of the plugin,
or for only selected commands when they are used in combination with a enabled command inside a permission.

Reasonable read only file access to files in the `APPLOCALDATA` could look like this:

```toml
[[set]]
identifier = "read-files-applocaldata"
description = '''
This set allows file read access to the `APPLOCALDATA` folder and
subfolders except for linux,
while it denies access to dangerous Tauri relevant files and
folders by default on windows.'''
permissions = ["scope-applocaldata-reasonable", "allow-read-file"]
```

These examples only highlight the scope functionality itself. Each plugin or application developer
needs to consider reasonable combinations of scope depending on their use cases.


# Develop
# Develop

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

Now that you have [everything set up](/start/), you are ready to run your application using Tauri.

If you are using an UI framework or JavaScript bundler you likely have access to a development server
that will speed up your development process, so if you haven't configured your app's dev URL and script
that starts it, you can do so via the [devUrl](/reference/config/#devurl) and
[beforeDevCommand](/reference/config/#beforedevcommand) config values:

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "build": {
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
    "beforeDevCommand": "npm run dev"
  }
}
```

:::note

Every framework has its own development tooling. It is outside of the scope of this document to cover them all or stay up to date.

Please refer to your framework's documentation to learn more and determine the correct values to be configured.

:::

Otherwise if you are not using a UI framework or module bundler you can point Tauri to your frontend source code
and the Tauri CLI will start a development server for you:

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "build": {
    "frontendDist": "./src"
  }
}
```

Note that in this example the `src` folder must include a `index.html` file along any other assets loaded by your frontend.

:::caution[Plain/Vanilla Dev Server Security]

The built-in Tauri development server does not support mutual authentication
or encryption. You should never use it for development on untrusted networks.
See the [development server security considerations](/security/lifecycle/#development-server)
for a more detailed explanation.

:::

### Developing Your Desktop Application

To develop your application for desktop, run the `tauri dev` command.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri dev"
  yarn="yarn tauri dev"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri dev"
  deno="deno task tauri dev"
  bun="bun tauri dev"
  cargo="cargo tauri dev"
/>

The first time you run this command, the Rust package manager may need **several minutes** to download and build all the required packages.
Since they are cached, subsequent builds are much faster, as only your code needs rebuilding.

Once Rust has finished building, the webview opens, displaying your web app.
You can make changes to your web app, and if your tooling supports it, the webview should update automatically, just like a browser.

#### Opening the Web Inspector

You can open the Web Inspector to debug your application by performing a right-click on the webview and clicking "Inspect" or
using the `Ctrl + Shift + I` shortcut on Windows and Linux or `Cmd + Option + I` shortcut on macOS.

### Developing your Mobile Application

Developing for mobile is similar to how desktop development works, but you must run `tauri android dev` or `tauri ios dev` instead:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri [android|ios] dev"
  yarn="yarn tauri [android|ios] dev"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri [android|ios] dev"
  deno="deno task tauri [android|ios] dev"
  bun="bun tauri [android|ios] dev"
  cargo="cargo tauri [android|ios] dev"
/>

The first time you run this command, the Rust package manager may need **several minutes** to download and build all the required packages.
Since they are cached, subsequent builds are much faster, as only your code needs rebuilding.

#### Development Server

The development server on mobile works similarly to the desktop one, but if you are trying to run on a physical iOS device,
you must configure it to listen to a particular address provided by the Tauri CLI, defined in the `TAURI_DEV_HOST` environment variable.
This address is either a public network address (which is the default behavior) or the actual iOS device TUN address - which is more secure, but currently
needs Xcode to connect to the device.

To use the iOS device's address you must open Xcode before running the dev command and ensure your device
is connected via network in the Window > Devices and Simulators menu.
Then you must run `tauri ios dev --force-ip-prompt` to select the iOS device address (a IPv6 address ending with **::2**).

To make your development server listen on the correct host to be accessible by the iOS device you must tweak its configuration
to use the `TAURI_DEV_HOST` value if it has been provided. Here is an example configuration for Vite:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

const host = process.env.TAURI_DEV_HOST;

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  clearScreen: false,
  server: {
    host: host || false,
    port: 1420,
    strictPort: true,
    hmr: host
      ? {
          protocol: 'ws',
          host,
          port: 1421,
        }
      : undefined,
  },
});
```

Check your framework's setup guide for more information.

:::note
Projects created with [create-tauri-app](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) configures
your development server for mobile dev out of the box.
:::

#### Device Selection

By default the mobile dev command tries to run your application in a connected device,
and fallbacks to prompting you to select a simulator to use.
To define the run target upfront you can provide the device or simulator name as argument:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri ios dev 'iPhone 15'"
  yarn="yarn tauri ios dev 'iPhone 15'"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri ios dev 'iPhone 15'"
  deno="deno task tauri ios dev 'iPhone 15'"
  bun="bun tauri ios dev 'iPhone 15'"
  cargo="cargo tauri ios dev 'iPhone 15'"
/>

#### Using Xcode or Android Studio

Alternatively you can choose to use Xcode or Android Studio to develop your application.
This can help you troubleshoot some development issues by using the IDE instead of the command line tools.
To open the mobile IDE instead of running on a connected device or simulator, use the `--open` flag:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri [android|ios] dev --open"
  yarn="yarn tauri [android|ios] dev --open"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri [android|ios] dev --open"
  deno="deno task tauri [android|ios] dev --open"
  bun="bun tauri [android|ios] dev --open"
  cargo="cargo tauri [android|ios] dev --open"
/>

:::note
If you intend on running the application on a physical iOS device you must also provide the `--host` argument
and your development server must use the `process.env.TAURI_DEV_HOST` value as host.
See your framework's setup guide for more information.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri [android|ios] dev --open --host"
  yarn="yarn tauri [android|ios] dev --open --host"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri [android|ios] dev --open --host"
  deno="deno task tauri [android|ios] dev --open --host"
  bun="bun tauri [android|ios] dev --open --host"
  cargo="cargo tauri [android|ios] dev --open --host"
/>
:::

:::caution
To use Xcode or Android Studio the Tauri CLI process **must** be running and **cannot** be killed.
It is recommended to use the `tauri [android|ios] dev --open` command and keep the process alive until you close the IDE.

  Safari must be used to access the Web Inspector for your iOS application.

  Open the Safari on your Mac machine, choose **Safari > Settings** in the menu bar, click **Advanced**, then select **Show features for web developers**.

  If you are running on a physical device you must enable **Web Inspector** in **Settings > Safari > Advanced**.

  After following all steps you should see a **Develop** menu in Safari, where you will find the connected devices and applications to inspect.
  Select on your device or simulator and click on **localhost** to open the Safari Developer Tools window.

- Android

  The inspector is enabled by default for Android emulators, but you must enable it for physical devices.
  Connect your Android device to the computer, open the **Settings** app in the Android device, select **About**, scroll to Build Number and tap that 7 times.
  This will enable Developer Mode for your Android device and the **Developer Options** settings.

  To enable application debugging on your device you must enter the **Developer Options** settings, toggle on the developer options switch
  and enable **USB Debugging**.

  :::note
  Each Android distribution has its own way to enable the Developer Mode, please check your manufacturer's documentation for more information.
  :::

  The Web Inspector for Android is powered by Google Chrome's DevTools and can be accessed by navigating to `chrome://inspect` in the Chrome browser.
  Your device or emulator should appear in the remote devices list if your Android application is running, and you can open the developer tools
  by clicking **inspect** on your device.

#### Troubleshooting

1. Error running build script on Xcode

Tauri hooks into the iOS Xcode project by creating a build phase that executes the Tauri CLI to compile the Rust source
as a library that is loaded at runtime. The build phase is executed on the Xcode process context, so it might not be able
to use shell modifications such as PATH additions, so be careful when using tools such as Node.js version managers which may not be compatible.

2. Network permission prompt on first iOS app execution

On the first time you execute `tauri ios dev` you might see iOS prompting you for permission to find and connect
to devices on your local network. This permission is required because to access your development server from an iOS device,
we must expose it in the local network. To run your app in your device you must click Allow and restart your application.

### Reacting to Source Code Changes

Similarly to how your webview reflects changes in real time,
Tauri watches your Rust files for changes so when you modify any of them your application is automatically rebuilt and restarted.

You can disable this behavior by using the `--no-watch` flag on the `tauri dev` command.

To restrict the files that are watched for changes you can create a `.taurignore` file in the src-tauri folder.
This file works just like a regular Git ignore file, so you can ignore any folder or file:

```filename=.taurignore
build/
src/generated/*.rs
deny.toml
```

### Using the Browser DevTools

Tauri's APIs only work in your app window, so once you start using them you won't be able to open your frontend in your system's browser anymore.

If you prefer using your browser's developer tooling, you must configure [tauri-invoke-http](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-invoke-http)
to bridge Tauri API calls through a HTTP server.

### Source Control

In your project repository, you **SHOULD** commit the `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` along with the `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` to git
because Cargo uses the lockfile to provide deterministic builds. As a result, it is recommended that all applications check in
their `Cargo.lock`. You **SHOULD NOT** commit the `src-tauri/target` folder or any of its contents.

# Calling the Frontend from Rust

The `@tauri-apps/api` NPM package offers APIs to listen to both global and webview-specific events.

- Listening to global events

  ```ts
  import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';

  type DownloadStarted = {
    url: string;
    downloadId: number;
    contentLength: number;
  };

  listen<DownloadStarted>('download-started', (event) => {
    console.log(
      `downloading ${event.payload.contentLength} bytes from ${event.payload.url}`
    );
  });
  ```

- Listening to webview-specific events

  ```ts
  import { getCurrentWebviewWindow } from '@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow';

  const appWebview = getCurrentWebviewWindow();
  appWebview.listen<string>('logged-in', (event) => {
    localStorage.setItem('session-token', event.payload);
  });
  ```

The `listen` function keeps the event listener registered for the entire lifetime of the application.
To stop listening on an event you can use the `unlisten` function which is returned by the `listen` function:

```js
import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';

const unlisten = await listen('download-started', (event) => {});
unlisten();
```

:::note
Always use the unlisten function when your execution context goes out of scope
such as when a component is unmounted.

When the page is reloaded or you navigate to another URL the listeners are unregistered automatically.
This does not apply to a Single Page Application (SPA) router though.
:::

Additionally Tauri provides a utility function for listening to an event exactly once:

```js
import { once } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';
import { getCurrentWebviewWindow } from '@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow';

once('ready', (event) => {});

const appWebview = getCurrentWebviewWindow();
appWebview.once('ready', () => {});
```

:::note
Events emitted in the frontend also triggers listeners registed by these APIs.
For more information see the [Calling Rust from the Frontend] documentation.
:::

#### Listening to Events on Rust

Global and webview-specific events are also delivered to listeners registered in Rust.

- Listening to global events

  ```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
  use tauri::Listener;

  #[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
  pub fn run() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
      .setup(|app| {
        app.listen("download-started", |event| {
          if let Ok(payload) = serde_json::from_str::<DownloadStarted>(&event.payload()) {
            println!("downloading {}", payload.url);
          }
        });
        Ok(())
      })
      .run(tauri::generate_context!())
      .expect("error while running tauri application");
  }
  ```

- Listening to webview-specific events

  ```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
  use tauri::{Listener, Manager};

  #[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
  pub fn run() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
      .setup(|app| {
        let webview = app.get_webview_window("main").unwrap();
        webview.listen("logged-in", |event| {
          let session_token = event.data;
          // save token..
        });
        Ok(())
      })
      .run(tauri::generate_context!())
      .expect("error while running tauri application");
  }
  ```

The `listen` function keeps the event listener registered for the entire lifetime of the application.
To stop listening on an event you can use the `unlisten` function:

```rust
// unlisten outside of the event handler scope:
let event_id = app.listen("download-started", |event| {});
app.unlisten(event_id);

// unlisten when some event criteria is matched
let handle = app.handle().clone();
app.listen("status-changed", |event| {
  if event.data == "ready" {
    handle.unlisten(event.id);
  }
});
```

Additionally Tauri provides a utility function for listening to an event exactly once:

```rust
app.once("ready", |event| {
  println!("app is ready");
});
```

In this case the event listener is immediately unregistered after its first trigger.

# Calling the Frontend from Rust

import { Content as FrontendListen } from './_sections/frontend-listen.mdx';

This document includes guides on how to communicate with your application frontend from your Rust code.
To see how to communicate with your Rust code from your frontend, see [Calling Rust from the Frontend].

The Rust side of your Tauri application can call the frontend by leveraging the Tauri event system,
using channels or directly evaluating JavaScript code.

## Event System

Tauri ships a simple event system you can use to have bi-directional communication between Rust and your frontend.

The event system was designed for situations where small amounts of data need to be streamed
or you need to implement a multi consumer multi producer pattern (e.g. push notification system).

The event system is not designed for low latency or high throughput situations.
See the [channels section](#channels) for the implementation optimized for streaming data.

The major differences between a Tauri command and a Tauri event are that events have no strong type support,
event payloads are always JSON strings making them not suitable for bigger messages
and there is no support of the [capabilities] system to fine grain control event data and channels.

The [AppHandle] and [WebviewWindow] types implement the event system traits [Listener] and [Emitter].

Events are either global (delivered to all listeners) or webview-specific (only delivered to the webview matching a given label).

### Global Events

To trigger a global event you can use the [Emitter#emit] function:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter};

#[tauri::command]
fn download(app: AppHandle, url: String) {
  app.emit("download-started", &url).unwrap();
  for progress in [1, 15, 50, 80, 100] {
    app.emit("download-progress", progress).unwrap();
  }
  app.emit("download-finished", &url).unwrap();
}
```

:::note
Global events are delivered to **all** listeners
:::

### Webview Event

To trigger an event to a listener registered by a specific webview you can use the [Emitter#emit_to] function:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter};

#[tauri::command]
fn login(app: AppHandle, user: String, password: String) {
  let authenticated = user == "tauri-apps" && password == "tauri";
  let result = if authenticated { "loggedIn" } else { "invalidCredentials" };
  app.emit_to("login", "login-result", result).unwrap();
}
```

It is also possible to trigger an event to a list of webviews by calling [Emitter#emit_filter].
In the following example we emit a open-file event to the main and file-viewer webviews:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter, EventTarget};

#[tauri::command]
fn open_file(app: AppHandle, path: std::path::PathBuf) {
  app.emit_filter("open-file", path, |target| match target {
    EventTarget::WebviewWindow { label } => label == "main" || label == "file-viewer",
    _ => false,
  }).unwrap();
}
```

:::note
Webview-specific events are **not** triggered to regular global event listeners.
To listen to **any** event you must use the `listen_any` function instead of `listen`,
which defines the listener to act as a catch-all for emitted events.
:::

### Event Payload

The event payload can be any [serializable][Serialize] type that also implements [Clone].
Let's enhance the download event example by using an object to emit more information in each event:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct DownloadStarted<'a> {
  url: &'a str,
  download_id: usize,
  content_length: usize,
}

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct DownloadProgress {
  download_id: usize,
  chunk_length: usize,
}

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct DownloadFinished {
  download_id: usize,
}

#[tauri::command]
fn download(app: AppHandle, url: String) {
  let content_length = 1000;
  let download_id = 1;

  app.emit("download-started", DownloadStarted {
    url: &url,
    download_id,
    content_length
  }).unwrap();

  for chunk_length in [15, 150, 35, 500, 300] {
    app.emit("download-progress", DownloadProgress {
      download_id,
      chunk_length,
    }).unwrap();
  }

  app.emit("download-finished", DownloadFinished { download_id }).unwrap();
}
```

### Listening to Events

Tauri provides APIs to listen to events on both the webview and the Rust interfaces.

#### Listening to Events on the Frontend

<FrontendListen />

## Channels

The event system is designed to be a simple two way communication that is globally available in your application.
Under the hood it directly evaluates JavaScript code so it might not be suitable to sending a large amount of data.

Channels are designed to be fast and deliver ordered data. They are used internally for streaming operations
such as download progress, child process output and WebSocket messages.

Let's rewrite our download command example to use channels instead of the event system:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, ipc::Channel};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase", rename_all_fields = "camelCase", tag = "event", content = "data")]
enum DownloadEvent<'a> {
  Started {
    url: &'a str,
    download_id: usize,
    content_length: usize,
  },
  Progress {
    download_id: usize,
    chunk_length: usize,
  },
  Finished {
    download_id: usize,
  },
}

#[tauri::command]
fn download(app: AppHandle, url: String, on_event: Channel<DownloadEvent>) {
  let content_length = 1000;
  let download_id = 1;

  on_event.send(DownloadEvent::Started {
    url: &url,
    download_id,
    content_length,
  }).unwrap();

  for chunk_length in [15, 150, 35, 500, 300] {
    on_event.send(DownloadEvent::Progress {
      download_id,
      chunk_length,
    }).unwrap();
  }

  on_event.send(DownloadEvent::Finished { download_id }).unwrap();
}
```

When calling the download command you must create the channel and provide it as an argument:

```ts
import { invoke, Channel } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';

type DownloadEvent =
  | {
      event: 'started';
      data: {
        url: string;
        downloadId: number;
        contentLength: number;
      };
    }
  | {
      event: 'progress';
      data: {
        downloadId: number;
        chunkLength: number;
      };
    }
  | {
      event: 'finished';
      data: {
        downloadId: number;
      };
    };

const onEvent = new Channel<DownloadEvent>();
onEvent.onmessage = (message) => {
  console.log(`got download event ${message.event}`);
};

await invoke('download', {
  url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tauri-apps/tauri/dev/crates/tauri-schema-generator/schemas/config.schema.json',
  onEvent,
});
```

## Evaluating JavaScript

To directly execute any JavaScript code on the webview context you can use the [`WebviewWindow#eval`] function:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::Manager;

tauri::Builder::default()
  .setup(|app| {
    let webview = app.get_webview_window("main").unwrap();
    webview.eval("console.log('hello from Rust')")?;
    Ok(())
  })
```

If the script to be evaluated is not so simple and must use input from Rust objects we recommend using the [serialize-to-javascript] crate.

# Calling Rust from the Frontend

import { Content as FrontendListen } from './_sections/frontend-listen.mdx';

This document includes guides on how to communicate with your Rust code from your application frontend.
To see how to communicate with your frontend from your Rust code, see [Calling the Frontend from Rust].

Tauri provides a [command](#commands) primitive for reaching Rust functions with type safety,
along with an [event system](#event-system) that is more dynamic.

## Commands

Tauri provides a simple yet powerful `command` system for calling Rust functions from your web app.
Commands can accept arguments and return values. They can also return errors and be `async`.

### Basic Example

Commands can be defined in your `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` file.
To create a command, just add a function and annotate it with `#[tauri::command]`:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
#[tauri::command]
fn my_custom_command() {
	println!("I was invoked from JavaScript!");
}
```

:::note
Command names must be unique.
:::

:::note
Commands defined in the `lib.rs` file cannot be marked as `pub` due to a limitation in the glue code generation.
You will see an error like this if you mark it as a public function:

```
error[E0255]: the name `__cmd__command_name` is defined multiple times
  --> src/lib.rs:28:8
   |
27 | #[tauri::command]
   | ----------------- previous definition of the macro `__cmd__command_name` here
28 | pub fn x() {}
   |        ^ `__cmd__command_name` reimported here
   |
   = note: `__cmd__command_name` must be defined only once in the macro namespace of this module
```

:::

You will have to provide a list of your commands to the builder function like so:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs" ins={4}
#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
pub fn run() {
	tauri::Builder::default()
		.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![my_custom_command])
		.run(tauri::generate_context!())
		.expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Now, you can invoke the command from your JavaScript code:

```javascript
// When using the Tauri API npm package:
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';

// When using the Tauri global script (if not using the npm package)
// Be sure to set `app.withGlobalTauri` in `tauri.conf.json` to true
const invoke = window.__TAURI__.core.invoke;

// Invoke the command
invoke('my_custom_command');
```

#### Defining Commands in a Separate Module

If your application defines a lot of components or if they can be grouped,
you can define commands in a separate module instead of bloating the `lib.rs` file.

As an example let's define a command in the `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` file:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/commands.rs"
#[tauri::command]
pub fn my_custom_command() {
	println!("I was invoked from JavaScript!");
}
```

:::note
When defining commands in a separate module they should be marked as `pub`.
:::

:::note
The command name is not scoped to the module so they must be unique even between modules.
:::

In the `lib.rs` file, define the module and provide the list of your commands accordingly;

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs" ins={6}
mod commands;

#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
pub fn run() {
	tauri::Builder::default()
		.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![commands::my_custom_command])
		.run(tauri::generate_context!())
		.expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Note the `commands::` prefix in the command list, which denotes the full path to the command function.

The command name in this example is `my_custom_command` so you can still call it by executing `invoke("my_custom_command")`
in your frontend, the `commands::` prefix is ignored.

#### WASM

When using a Rust frontend to call `invoke()` without arguments, you will need to adapt your frontend code as below.
The reason is that Rust doesn't support optional arguments.

```rust ins={4-5}
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    // invoke without arguments
    #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = ["window", "__TAURI__", "core"], js_name = invoke)]
    async fn invoke_without_args(cmd: &str) -> JsValue;

    // invoke with arguments (default)
    #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = ["window", "__TAURI__", "core"])]
    async fn invoke(cmd: &str, args: JsValue) -> JsValue;

    // They need to have different names!
}
```

### Passing Arguments

Your command handlers can take arguments:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn my_custom_command(invoke_message: String) {
	println!("I was invoked from JavaScript, with this message: {}", invoke_message);
}
```

Arguments should be passed as a JSON object with camelCase keys:

```javascript
invoke('my_custom_command', { invokeMessage: 'Hello!' });
```

:::note
You can use `snake_case` for the arguments with the `rename_all` attribute:

```rust
#[tauri::command(rename_all = "snake_case")]
fn my_custom_command(invoke_message: String) {}
```

```javascript
invoke('my_custom_command', { invoke_message: 'Hello!' });
```

:::

Arguments can be of any type, as long as they implement [`serde::Deserialize`].

The corresponding JavaScript:

```javascript
invoke('my_custom_command', { invoke_message: 'Hello!' });
```

### Returning Data

Command handlers can return data as well:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn my_custom_command() -> String {
	"Hello from Rust!".into()
}
```

The `invoke` function returns a promise that resolves with the returned value:

```javascript
invoke('my_custom_command').then((message) => console.log(message));
```

Returned data can be of any type, as long as it implements [`serde::Serialize`].

#### Returning Array Buffers

Return values that implements [`serde::Serialize`] are serialized to JSON when the response is sent to the frontend.
This can slow down your application if you try to return a large data such as a file or a download HTTP response.
To return array buffers in an optimized way, use [`tauri::ipc::Response`]:

```rust
use tauri::ipc::Response;
#[tauri::command]
fn read_file() -> Response {
	let data = std::fs::read("/path/to/file").unwrap();
	tauri::ipc::Response::new(data)
}
```

### Error Handling

If your handler could fail and needs to be able to return an error, have the function return a `Result`:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn login(user: String, password: String) -> Result<String, String> {
	if user == "tauri" && password == "tauri" {
		// resolve
		Ok("logged_in".to_string())
	} else {
		// reject
		Err("invalid credentials".to_string())
	}
}
```

If the command returns an error, the promise will reject, otherwise, it resolves:

```javascript
invoke('login', { user: 'tauri', password: '0j4rijw8=' })
  .then((message) => console.log(message))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

As mentioned above, everything returned from commands must implement [`serde::Serialize`], including errors.
This can be problematic if you're working with error types from Rust's std library or external crates as most error types do not implement it.
In simple scenarios you can use `map_err` to convert these errors to `String`:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn my_custom_command() -> Result<(), String> {
	std::fs::File::open("path/to/file").map_err(|err| err.to_string())?;
	// Return `null` on success
	Ok(())
}
```

Since this is not very idiomatic you may want to create your own error type which implements `serde::Serialize`.
In the following example, we use the [`thiserror`] crate to help create the error type.
It allows you to turn enums into error types by deriving the `thiserror::Error` trait.
You can consult its documentation for more details.

```rust
// create the error type that represents all errors possible in our program
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
enum Error {
	#[error(transparent)]
	Io(#[from] std::io::Error)
}

// we must manually implement serde::Serialize
impl serde::Serialize for Error {
	fn serialize<S>(&self, serializer: S) -> Result<S::Ok, S::Error>
	where
		S: serde::ser::Serializer,
	{
		serializer.serialize_str(self.to_string().as_ref())
	}
}

#[tauri::command]
fn my_custom_command() -> Result<(), Error> {
	// This will return an error
	std::fs::File::open("path/that/does/not/exist")?;
	// Return `null` on success
	Ok(())
}
```

A custom error type has the advantage of making all possible errors explicit so readers can quickly identify what errors can happen.
This saves other people (and yourself) enormous amounts of time when reviewing and refactoring code later.<br/>
It also gives you full control over the way your error type gets serialized.
In the above example, we simply returned the error message as a string, but you could assign each error a code
so you could more easily map it to a similar looking TypeScript error enum for example:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
enum Error {
  #[error(transparent)]
  Io(#[from] std::io::Error),
  #[error("failed to parse as string: {0}")]
  Utf8(#[from] std::str::Utf8Error),
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
#[serde(tag = "kind", content = "message")]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
enum ErrorKind {
  Io(String),
  Utf8(String),
}

impl serde::Serialize for Error {
  fn serialize<S>(&self, serializer: S) -> Result<S::Ok, S::Error>
  where
    S: serde::ser::Serializer,
  {
    let error_message = self.to_string();
    let error_kind = match self {
      Self::Io(_) => ErrorKind::Io(error_message),
      Self::Utf8(_) => ErrorKind::Utf8(error_message),
    };
    error_kind.serialize(serializer)
  }
}

#[tauri::command]
fn read() -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error> {
  let data = std::fs::read("/path/to/file")?;
	Ok(data)
}
```

In your frontend you now get a `{ kind: 'io' | 'utf8', message: string }` error object:

```ts
type ErrorKind = {
  kind: 'io' | 'utf8';
  message: string;
};

invoke('read').catch((e: ErrorKind) => {});
```

### Async Commands

Asynchronous commands are preferred in Tauri to perform heavy work in a manner that doesn't result in UI freezes or slowdowns.

Async commands are executed on a separate async task using [`async_runtime::spawn`].
Commands without the _async_ keyword are executed on the main thread unless defined with _#[tauri::command(async)]_.

:::

**If your command needs to run asynchronously, simply declare it as `async`.**

:::caution

You need to be careful when creating asynchronous functions using Tauri.
Currently, you cannot simply include borrowed arguments in the signature of an asynchronous function.
Some common examples of types like this are `&str` and `State<'_, Data>`.
This limitation is tracked here: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2533 and workarounds are shown below.

:::

When working with borrowed types, you have to make additional changes. These are your two main options:

**Option 1**: Convert the type, such as `&str` to a similar type that is not borrowed, such as `String`.
This may not work for all types, for example `State<'_, Data>`.

_Example:_

```rust
// Declare the async function using String instead of &str, as &str is borrowed and thus unsupported
#[tauri::command]
async fn my_custom_command(value: String) -> String {
	// Call another async function and wait for it to finish
	some_async_function().await;
	value
}
```

**Option 2**: Wrap the return type in a [`Result`]. This one is a bit harder to implement, but works for all types.

Use the return type `Result<a, b>`, replacing `a` with the type you wish to return, or `()` if you wish to return `null`, and replacing `b` with an error type to return if something goes wrong, or `()` if you wish to have no optional error returned. For example:

- `Result<String, ()>` to return a String, and no error.
- `Result<(), ()>` to return `null`.
- `Result<bool, Error>` to return a boolean or an error as shown in the [Error Handling](#error-handling) section above.

_Example:_

```rust
// Return a Result<String, ()> to bypass the borrowing issue
#[tauri::command]
async fn my_custom_command(value: &str) -> Result<String, ()> {
	// Call another async function and wait for it to finish
	some_async_function().await;
	// Note that the return value must be wrapped in `Ok()` now.
	Ok(format!(value))
}
```

##### Invoking from JavaScript

Since invoking the command from JavaScript already returns a promise, it works just like any other command:

```javascript
invoke('my_custom_command', { value: 'Hello, Async!' }).then(() =>
  console.log('Completed!')
);
```

### Channels

The Tauri channel is the recommended mechanism for streaming data such as streamed HTTP responses to the frontend.
The following example reads a file and notifies the frontend of the progress in chunks of 4096 bytes:

```rust
use tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;

#[tauri::command]
async fn load_image(path: std::path::PathBuf, reader: tauri::ipc::Channel<&[u8]>) {
  // for simplicity this example does not include error handling
  let mut file = tokio::fs::File::open(path).await.unwrap();

  let mut chunk = vec![0; 4096];

  loop {
    let len = file.read(&mut chunk).await.unwrap();
    if len == 0 {
      // Length of zero means end of file.
      break;
    }
    reader.send(&chunk).unwrap();
  }
}
```

See the [channels documentation] for more information.

### Accessing the WebviewWindow in Commands

Commands can access the `WebviewWindow` instance that invoked the message:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
#[tauri::command]
async fn my_custom_command(webview_window: tauri::WebviewWindow) {
	println!("WebviewWindow: {}", webview_window.label());
}
```

### Accessing an AppHandle in Commands

Commands can access an `AppHandle` instance:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
#[tauri::command]
async fn my_custom_command(app_handle: tauri::AppHandle) {
	let app_dir = app_handle.path_resolver().app_dir();
	use tauri::GlobalShortcutManager;
	app_handle.global_shortcut_manager().register("CTRL + U", move || {});
}
```

### Accessing Managed State

Tauri can manage state using the `manage` function on `tauri::Builder`.
The state can be accessed on a command using `tauri::State`:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
struct MyState(String);

#[tauri::command]
fn my_custom_command(state: tauri::State<MyState>) {
	assert_eq!(state.0 == "some state value", true);
}

#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
pub fn run() {
	tauri::Builder::default()
		.manage(MyState("some state value".into()))
		.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![my_custom_command])
		.run(tauri::generate_context!())
		.expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### Accessing Raw Request

Tauri commands can also access the full [`tauri::ipc::Request`] object which includes the raw body payload and the request headers.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
enum Error {
  #[error("unexpected request body")]
  RequestBodyMustBeRaw,
  #[error("missing `{0}` header")]
  MissingHeader(&'static str),
}

impl serde::Serialize for Error {
  fn serialize<S>(&self, serializer: S) -> Result<S::Ok, S::Error>
  where
    S: serde::ser::Serializer,
  {
    serializer.serialize_str(self.to_string().as_ref())
  }
}

#[tauri::command]
fn upload(request: tauri::ipc::Request) -> Result<(), Error> {
  let tauri::ipc::InvokeBody::Raw(upload_data) = request.body() else {
    return Err(Error::RequestBodyMustBeRaw);
  };
  let Some(authorization_header) = request.headers().get("Authorization") else {
    return Err(Error::MissingHeader("Authorization"));
  };

  // upload...

  Ok(())
}
```

In the frontend you can call invoke() sending a raw request body by providing an ArrayBuffer or Uint8Array on the payload argument,
and include request headers in the third argument:

```js
const data = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]);
await __TAURI__.core.invoke('upload', data, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'apikey',
  },
});
```

### Creating Multiple Commands

The `tauri::generate_handler!` macro takes an array of commands. To register
multiple commands, you cannot call invoke_handler multiple times. Only the last
call will be used. You must pass each command to a single call of
`tauri::generate_handler!`.

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
#[tauri::command]
fn cmd_a() -> String {
	"Command a"
}
#[tauri::command]
fn cmd_b() -> String {
	"Command b"
}

#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
pub fn run() {
	tauri::Builder::default()
		.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![cmd_a, cmd_b])
		.run(tauri::generate_context!())
		.expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### Complete Example

Any or all of the above features can be combined:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
struct Database;

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct CustomResponse {
	message: String,
	other_val: usize,
}

async fn some_other_function() -> Option<String> {
	Some("response".into())
}

#[tauri::command]
async fn my_custom_command(
	window: tauri::Window,
	number: usize,
	database: tauri::State<'_, Database>,
) -> Result<CustomResponse, String> {
	println!("Called from {}", window.label());
	let result: Option<String> = some_other_function().await;
	if let Some(message) = result {
		Ok(CustomResponse {
			message,
			other_val: 42 + number,
		})
	} else {
		Err("No result".into())
	}
}

#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
pub fn run() {
	tauri::Builder::default()
		.manage(Database {})
		.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![my_custom_command])
		.run(tauri::generate_context!())
		.expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

```javascript
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';

// Invocation from JavaScript
invoke('my_custom_command', {
  number: 42,
})
  .then((res) =>
    console.log(`Message: ${res.message}, Other Val: ${res.other_val}`)
  )
  .catch((e) => console.error(e));
```

## Event System

The event system is a simpler communication mechanism between your frontend and the Rust.
Unlike commands, events are not type safe, are always async, cannot return values and only supports JSON payloads.

### Global Events

To trigger a global event you can use the [event.emit] or the [WebviewWindow#emit] functions:

```js
import { emit } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';
import { getCurrentWebviewWindow } from '@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow';

// emit(eventName, payload)
emit('file-selected', '/path/to/file');

const appWebview = getCurrentWebviewWindow();
appWebview.emit('route-changed', { url: window.location.href });
```

:::note
Global events are delivered to **all** listeners
:::

### Webview Event

To trigger an event to a listener registered by a specific webview you can use the [event.emitTo] or the [WebviewWindow#emitTo] functions:

```js
import { emitTo } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';
import { getCurrentWebviewWindow } from '@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow';

// emitTo(webviewLabel, eventName, payload)
emitTo('settings', 'settings-update-requested', {
  key: 'notification',
  value: 'all',
});

const appWebview = getCurrentWebviewWindow();
appWebview.emitTo('editor', 'file-changed', {
  path: '/path/to/file',
  contents: 'file contents',
});
```

:::note
Webview-specific events are **not** triggered to regular global event listeners.
To listen to **any** event you must provide the `{ target: { kind: 'Any' } }` option to the [event.listen] function,
which defines the listener to act as a catch-all for emitted events:

```js
import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';
listen(
  'state-changed',
  (event) => {
    console.log('got state changed event', event);
  },
  {
    target: { kind: 'Any' },
  }
);
```

:::

# Configuration Files

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

Since Tauri is a toolkit for building applications there can be many files to configure project settings. Some common files that you may run across are `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json` and `Cargo.toml`. We briefly explain each on this page to help point you in the right direction for which files to modify.

## Tauri Config

The Tauri configuration is used to define the source of your Web app, describe your application's metadata, configure bundles, set plugin configurations, modify runtime behavior by configuring windows, tray icons, menus and more.

This file is used by the Tauri runtime and the Tauri CLI. You can define build settings (such as the [command run before `tauri build`][before-build-command] or [`tauri dev`][before-dev-command] kicks in), set the [name](/reference/config/#productname) and [version of your app](/reference/config/#version), [control the Tauri runtime][appconfig], and [configure plugins].

:::tip
You can find all of the options in the [configuration reference].
:::

### Supported Formats

The default Tauri config format is JSON. The JSON5 or TOML format can be enabled by adding the `config-json5` or `config-toml` feature flag (respectively) to the `tauri` and `tauri-build` dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.

```toml title=Cargo.toml
[build-dependencies]
tauri-build = { version = "2.0.0", features = [ "config-json5" ] }

[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2.0.0", features = [  "config-json5" ] }
```

The structure and values are the same across all formats, however, the formatting should be consistent with the respective file's format:

```json5 title=tauri.conf.json or tauri.conf.json5
{
  build: {
    devUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
    // start the dev server
    beforeDevCommand: 'npm run dev',
  },
  bundle: {
    active: true,
    icon: ['icons/app.png'],
  },
  app: {
    windows: [
      {
        title: 'MyApp',
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: {
    updater: {
      pubkey: 'updater pub key',
      endpoints: ['https://my.app.updater/{{target}}/{{current_version}}'],
    },
  },
}
```

```toml title=Tauri.toml
[build]
dev-url = "http://localhost:3000"
# start the dev server
before-dev-command = "npm run dev"

[bundle]
active = true
icon = ["icons/app.png"]

[[app.windows]]
title = "MyApp"

[plugins.updater]
pubkey = "updater pub key"
endpoints = ["https://my.app.updater/{{target}}/{{current_version}}"]
```

Note that JSON5 and TOML supports comments, and TOML can use kebab-case for config names which are more idiomatic. Field names are case-sensitive in all 3 formats.

### Platform-specific Configuration

In addition to the default configuration file, Tauri can read a platform-specific configuration from:

- `tauri.linux.conf.json` or `Tauri.linux.toml` for Linux
- `tauri.windows.conf.json` or `Tauri.windows.toml` for Windows
- `tauri.macos.conf.json` or `Tauri.macos.toml` for macOS
- `tauri.android.conf.json` or `Tauri.android.toml` for Android
- `tauri.ios.conf.json` or `Tauri.ios.toml` for iOS

The platform-specific configuration file gets merged with the main configuration object following the [JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)] specification.

For example, given the following base `tauri.conf.json`:

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "productName": "MyApp",
  "bundle": {
    "resources": ["./resources"]
  },
  "plugins": {
    "deep-link": {}
  }
}
```

And the given `tauri.linux.conf.json`:

```json title=tauri.linux.conf.json
{
  "productName": "my-app",
  "bundle": {
    "resources": ["./linux-assets"]
  },
  "plugins": {
    "cli": {
      "description": "My app",
      "subcommands": {
        "update": {}
      }
    },
    "deep-link": {}
  }
}
```

The resolved configuration for Linux would be the following object:

```json
{
  "productName": "my-app",
  "bundle": {
    "resources": ["./linux-assets"]
  },
  "plugins": {
    "cli": {
      "description": "My app",
      "subcommands": {
        "update": {}
      }
    },
    "deep-link": {}
  }
}
```

Additionally you can provide a configuration to be merged via the CLI, see the following section for more information.

### Extending the Configuration

The Tauri CLI allows you to extend the Tauri configuration when running one of the `dev`, `android dev`, `ios dev`, `build`, `android build`, `ios build` or `bundle` commands.
The configuration extension can be provided by the `--config` argument either as a raw JSON string or as a path to a JSON file.
Tauri uses the [JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)] specification to merge the provided configuration value with the originally resolved configuration object.

This mechanism can be used to define multiple flavours of your application or have more flexibility when configuring your application bundles.

For instance to distribute a completely isolated _beta_ application you can use this feature to configure a separate application name and identifier:

```json title=src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json
{
  "productName": "My App Beta",
  "identifier": "com.myorg.myappbeta"
}
```

And to distribute this separate _beta_ app you provide this configuration file when building it:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --config src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json"
  deno="deno task tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json"
  bun="bun tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json"
/>

## `Cargo.toml`

Cargo's manifest file is used to declare Rust crates your app depends on, metadata about your app, and other Rust-related features. If you do not intend to do backend development using Rust for your app then you may not be modifying it much, but it's important to know that it exists and what it does.

Below is an example of a barebones `Cargo.toml` file for a Tauri project:

```toml title=Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A Tauri App"
authors = ["you"]
license = ""
repository = ""
default-run = "app"
edition = "2021"
rust-version = "1.57"

[build-dependencies]
tauri-build = { version = "2.0.0" }

[dependencies]
serde_json = "1.0"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
tauri = { version = "2.0.0", features = [ ] }
```

The most important parts to take note of are the `tauri-build` and `tauri` dependencies. Generally, they must both be on the latest minor versions as the Tauri CLI, but this is not strictly required. If you encounter issues while trying to run your app you should check that any Tauri versions (`tauri` and `tauri-cli`) are on the latest versions for their respective minor releases.

Cargo version numbers use [Semantic Versioning]. Running `cargo update` in the `src-tauri` folder will pull the latest available Semver-compatible versions of all dependencies. For example, if you specify `2.0.0` as the version for `tauri-build`, Cargo will detect and download version `2.0.0.0` because it is the latest Semver-compatible version available. Tauri will update the major version number whenever a breaking change is introduced, meaning you should always be capable of safely upgrading to the latest minor and patch versions without fear of your code breaking.

If you want to use a specific crate version you can use exact versions instead by prepending `=` to the version number of the dependency:

```
tauri-build = { version = "=2.0.0" }
```

An additional thing to take note of is the `features=[]` portion of the `tauri` dependency. Running `tauri dev` and `tauri build` will automatically manage which features need to be enabled in your project based on the your Tauri configuration. For more information about `tauri` feature flags see the [documentation][tauri Cargo features].

When you build your application a `Cargo.lock` file is produced. This file is used primarily for ensuring that the same dependencies are used across machines during development (similar to `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `package-lock.json` in Node.js). It is recommended to commit this file to your source repository so you get consistent builds.

To learn more about the Cargo manifest file please refer to the [official documentation][cargo-manifest].

## `package.json`

This is the package file used by Node.js. If the frontend of your Tauri app is developed using Node.js-based technologies (such as `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`) this file is used to configure the frontend dependencies and scripts.

An example of a barebones `package.json` file for a Tauri project might look a little something like this:

```json title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "command to start your app development mode",
    "build": "command to build your app frontend",
    "tauri": "tauri"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@tauri-apps/api": "^2.0.0.0",
    "@tauri-apps/cli": "^2.0.0.0"
  }
}
```

It's common to use the `"scripts"` section to store the commands used to launch and build the frontend used by your Tauri application. The above `package.json` file specifies the `dev` command that you can run using `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the frontend framework and the `build` command that you can run using `yarn build` or `npm run build` to build your frontend's Web assets to be added by Tauri in production. The most convenient way to use these scripts is to hook them with the Tauri CLI via the Tauri configuration's [beforeDevCommand][before-dev-command] and [beforeBuildCommand][before-build-command] hooks:

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "build": {
    "beforeDevCommand": "yarn dev",
    "beforeBuildCommand": "yarn build"
  }
}
```

:::note
The `"tauri"` script is only needed when using `npm`
:::

The dependencies object specifies which dependencies Node.js should download when you run either `yarn`, `pnpm install` or `npm install` (in this case the Tauri CLI and API).

In addition to the `package.json` file you may see either a `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `package-lock.json` file. These files assist in ensuring that when you download the dependencies later you'll get the exact same versions that you have used during development (similar to `Cargo.lock` in Rust).

To learn more about the `package.json` file format please refer to the [official documentation][npm-package].

# Debug

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

With all the moving pieces in Tauri, you may run into a problem that requires debugging. There are many locations where error details are printed, and Tauri includes some tools to make the debugging process more straightforward.

## Development Only Code

One of the most useful tools in your toolkit for debugging is the ability to add debugging statements in your code. However, you generally don't want these to end up in production, which is where the ability to check whether you're running in development mode or not comes in handy.

### In Rust

```rs frame=none
fn main() {
  // Whether the current instance was started with `tauri dev` or not.
  #[cfg(dev)]
  {
    // `tauri dev` only code
  }
  if cfg!(dev) {
    // `tauri dev` only code
  } else {
    // `tauri build` only code
  }
  let is_dev: bool = tauri::is_dev();

  // Whether debug assertions are enabled or not. This is true for `tauri dev` and `tauri build --debug`.
  #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
  {
    // Debug only code
  }
  if cfg!(debug_assertions) {
    // Debug only code
  } else {
    // Production only code
  }
}
```

{/* TODO: js version */}

## Rust Console

The first place to look for errors is in the Rust Console. This is in the terminal where you ran, e.g., `tauri dev`. You can use the following code to print something to that console from within a Rust file:

```rust frame=none
println!("Message from Rust: {}", msg);
```

Sometimes you may have an error in your Rust code, and the Rust compiler can give you lots of information. If, for example, `tauri dev` crashes, you can rerun it like this on Linux and macOS:

```shell frame=none
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 tauri dev
```

or like this on Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell frame=none
$env:RUST_BACKTRACE=1
tauri dev
```

This command gives you a granular stack trace. Generally speaking, the Rust compiler helps you by
giving you detailed information about the issue, such as:

```bash frame=none
error[E0425]: cannot find value `sun` in this scope
  --> src/main.rs:11:5
   |
11 |     sun += i.to_string().parse::<u64>().unwrap();
   |     ^^^ help: a local variable with a similar name exists: `sum`

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0425`.
```

## WebView Console

Right-click in the WebView, and choose `Inspect Element`. This opens up a web-inspector similar to the Chrome or Firefox dev tools you are used to.
You can also use the `Ctrl + Shift + i` shortcut on Linux and Windows, and `Command + Option + i` on macOS to open the inspector.

The inspector is platform-specific, rendering the webkit2gtk WebInspector on Linux, Safari's inspector on macOS and the Microsoft Edge DevTools on Windows.

### Opening Devtools Programmatically

You can control the inspector window visibility by using the [`WebviewWindow::open_devtools`] and [`WebviewWindow::close_devtools`] functions:

```rust
tauri::Builder::default()
  .setup(|app| {
    #[cfg(debug_assertions)] // only include this code on debug builds
    {
      let window = app.get_webview_window("main").unwrap();
      window.open_devtools();
      window.close_devtools();
    }
    Ok(())
  });
```

### Using the Inspector in Production

By default, the inspector is only enabled in development and debug builds unless you enable it with a Cargo feature.

#### Create a Debug Build

To create a debug build, run the `tauri build --debug` command.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --debug"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --debug"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --debug"
  deno="deno task tauri build --debug"
  bun="bun tauri build --debug"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --debug"
/>

Like the normal build and dev processes, building takes some time the first time you run this command but is significantly faster on subsequent runs.
The final bundled app has the development console enabled and is placed in `src-tauri/target/debug/bundle`.

You can also run a built app from the terminal, giving you the Rust compiler notes (in case of errors) or your `println` messages. Browse to the file `src-tauri/target/(release|debug)/[app name]` and run it in directly in your console or double-click the executable itself in the filesystem (note: the console closes on errors with this method).

##### Enable Devtools Feature

:::danger

The devtools API is private on macOS. Using private APIs on macOS prevents your application from being accepted to the App Store.

:::

To enable the devtools in **production builds**, you must enable the `devtools` Cargo feature in the `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "...", features = ["...", "devtools"] }
```

## Debugging the Core Process

The Core process is powered by Rust so you can use GDB or LLDB to debug it. You can follow the [Debugging in VS Code] guide to learn how to use the LLDB VS Code Extension to debug the Core Process of Tauri applications.

[`WebviewWindow::open_devtools`]: https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/webview/struct.WebviewWindow.html#method.open_devtools

# CrabNebula DevTools

import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import devToolsPrint from '@assets/develop/Debug/crabnebula-devtools.png';

[CrabNebula](https://crabnebula.dev/) provides a free [DevTools](https://crabnebula.dev/devtools/) application for Tauri as part of its partnership with the Tauri project. This application allows you to instrument your Tauri app by capturing its embedded assets, Tauri configuration file, logs and spans and providing a web frontend to seamlessly visualize data in real time.

With the CrabNebula DevTools you can inspect your app's log events (including logs from dependencies), track down the performance of your command calls and overall Tauri API usage, with a special interface for Tauri events and commands, including payload, responses and inner logs and execution spans.

To enable the CrabNebula DevTools, install the devtools crate:

```sh frame=none
cargo add tauri-plugin-devtools@2.0.0
```

And initialize the plugin as soon as possible in your main function:

```rust
fn main() {
    // This should be called as early in the execution of the app as possible
    #[cfg(debug_assertions)] // only enable instrumentation in development builds
    let devtools = tauri_plugin_devtools::init();

    let mut builder = tauri::Builder::default();

    #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
    {
        builder = builder.plugin(devtools);
    }

    builder
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

And then run your app as usual, if everything is set up correctly devtools will print the following message:

<Image src={devToolsPrint} alt="DevTools message on terminal" />

:::note
In this case we only initialize the devtools plugin for debug applications, which is recommended.

# Debug in Neovim

There are many different plugins that can be used to debug Rust code in Neovim. This guide will show you how to set up `nvim-dap` and some additional plugins to debug Tauri application.

### Prerequisites

`nvim-dap` extension requires `codelldb` binary. Download the version for your system from https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/releases and unzip it. We will point to it later in the `nvim-dap` configuration.

### Configuring nvim-dap

Install [`nvim-dap`](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and [`nvim-dap-ui`](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) plugins. Follow the instructions provided on their github pages or simply use your favourite plugin manager.
Note that `nvim-dap-ui` requires `nvim-nio` plugin.

Next, setup the plugin in your Neovim configuration:

```lua title="init.lua"
local dap = require("dap")

dap.adapters.codelldb = {
  type = 'server',
  port = "${port}",
  executable = {
    -- Change this to your path!
    command = '/opt/codelldb/adapter/codelldb',
    args = {"--port", "${port}"},
  }
}

dap.configurations.rust= {
  {
    name = "Launch file",
    type = "codelldb",
    request = "launch",
    program = function()
      return vim.fn.input('Path to executable: ', vim.fn.getcwd() .. '/target/debug/', 'file')
    end,
    cwd = '${workspaceFolder}',
    stopOnEntry = false
  },
}
```

This setup will ask you to point to the Tauri App binary you want to debug each time you lanuch the debugger.

Optionally, you can setup `nvim-dap-ui` plugin to toggle debugger view automatically each time debugging session starts and stops:

```lua title="init.lua"
local dapui = require("dapui")
dapui.setup()

dap.listeners.before.attach.dapui_config = function()
  dapui.open()
end
dap.listeners.before.launch.dapui_config = function()
  dapui.open()
end
dap.listeners.before.event_terminated.dapui_config = function()
  dapui.close()
end
dap.listeners.before.event_exited.dapui_config = function()
  dapui.close()
end

```

Lastly, you can change the default way the breakpoints are displayed in the editor:

```lua title="init.lua"
vim.fn.sign_define('DapBreakpoint',{ text ='🟥', texthl ='', linehl ='', numhl =''})
vim.fn.sign_define('DapStopped',{ text ='▶️', texthl ='', linehl ='', numhl =''})
```

### Starting the dev server

Since we're not using Tauri CLI to launch the app the development server will not start automatically. To control the state of development server from Neovim you can use the [overseer](https://github.com/stevearc/overseer.nvim/tree/master) plugin.

Best way to control tasks running in background is to use [VS Code style task](https://github.com/stevearc/overseer.nvim/blob/master/doc/guides.md#vs-code-tasks) configuration. To do this create a `.vscode/tasks.json` file in the projects directory.

You can find example task configuration for project using `trunk` below.

```json title=".vscode/tasks.json"
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "process",
      "label": "dev server",
      "command": "trunk",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "isBackground": true,
      "presentation": {
        "revealProblems": "onProblem"
      },
      "problemMatcher": {
        "pattern": {
          "regexp": "^error:.*",
          "file": 1,
          "line": 2
        },
        "background": {
          "activeOnStart": false,
          "beginsPattern": ".*Rebuilding.*",
          "endsPattern": ".*server listening at:.*"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example key bindings

Below you can find example key bindings to start and control debugging sessions.

```lua title="init.lua"
vim.keymap.set('n', '<F5>', function() dap.continue() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<F6>', function() dap.disconnect({ terminateDebuggee = true }) end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<F10>', function() dap.step_over() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<F11>', function() dap.step_into() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<F12>', function() dap.step_out() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>b', function() dap.toggle_breakpoint() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>o', function() overseer.toggle() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>R', function() overseer.run_template() end)
```

# Debug in JetBrains IDEs

{/* TODO: Add support to light/dark mode images */}

In this guide, we'll be setting up JetBrains RustRover for debugging the [Core Process of your Tauri app](/concept/process-model/#the-core-process). It also mostly applies to IntelliJ and CLion.

## Setting up a Cargo project

Depending on which frontend stack is used in a project, the project directory may or may not be a Cargo project. By default, Tauri places the Rust project in a subdirectory called `src-tauri`. It creates a Cargo project in the root directory only if Rust is used for frontend development as well.

If there's no `Cargo.toml` file at the top level, you need to attach the project manually. Open the Cargo tool window (in the main menu, go to **View | Tool Windows | Cargo**), click **+** (**Attach Cargo Project**) on the toolbar, and select the `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` file.

Alternatively, you could create a top-level Cargo workspace manually by adding the following file to the project's root directory:

```toml title=Cargo.toml
[workspace]
members = ["src-tauri"]
```

Before you proceed, make sure that your project is fully loaded. If the Cargo tool window shows all the modules and targets of the workspace, you're good to go.

## Setting up Run Configurations

You will need to set up two separate Run/Debug configurations:

- one for launching the Tauri app in debugging mode,
- another one for running your frontend development server of choice.

### Tauri App

1. In the main menu, go to **Run | Edit Configurations**.
2. In the **Run/Debug Configurations** dialog:

- To create a new configuration, click **+** on the toolbar and select **Cargo**.

![Add Run/Debug Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/add-cargo-config-light.png)
{/* ![Add Run/Debug Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/add-cargo-config-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) */}

With that created, we need to configure RustRover, so it instructs Cargo to build our app without any default features. This will tell Tauri to use your development server instead of reading assets from the disk. Normally this flag is passed by the Tauri CLI, but since we're completely sidestepping that here, we need to pass the flag manually.

![Add `--no-default-features` flag](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/set-no-default-features-light.png)
{/* ![Add `--no-default-features` flag](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/set-no-default-features-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) */}

Now we can optionally rename the Run/Debug Configuration to something more memorable, in this example we called it "Run Tauri App", but you can name it whatever you want.

![Rename Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/rename-configuration-light.png)
{/* ![Rename Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/rename-configuration-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) */}

### Development Server

The above configuration will use Cargo directly to build the Rust application and attach the debugger to it. This means we completely sidestep the Tauri CLI, so features like the `beforeDevCommand` and `beforeBuildCommand` will **not** be executed. We need to take care of that by running the development server manually.

To create the corresponding Run configuration, you need to check the actual development server in use. Look for the `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file and find the following line:

```json
    "beforeDevCommand": "pnpm dev"
```

For `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`, you could use the **npm** Run Configuration, for example:

![NPM Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/npm-configuration-light.png)
{/* ![NPM Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/npm-configuration-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) */}

Make sure you have the correct values in the **Command**, **Scripts**, and **Package Manager** fields.

If your development server is `trunk` for Rust-based WebAssembly frontend frameworks, you could use the generic **Shell Script** Run Configuration:

![Trunk Serve Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/trunk-configuration-light.png)
{/* ![Trunk Serve Configuration](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/trunk-configuration-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) */}

## Launching a Debugging Session

To launch a debugging session, you first need to run your development server, and then start debugging the Tauri App by clicking the **Debug** button next to the Run Configurations Switcher. RustRover will automatically recognize breakpoints placed in any Rust file in your project and stop on the first one hit.

![Debug Session](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/debug-session-light.png)
{/* ![Debug Session](@assets/develop/Debug/rustrover/debug-session-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) */}

From this point, you can explore the values of your variables, step further into the code, and check what's going at runtime in detail.

# Debug in VS Code

This guide will walk you through setting up VS Code for debugging the [Core Process of your Tauri app](/concept/process-model/#the-core-process).

## All platforms with vscode-lldb extension

### Prerequisites

Install the [`vscode-lldb`] extension.

[`vscode-lldb`]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb

### Configure launch.json

Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file and paste the below JSON contents into it:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "lldb",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Tauri Development Debug",
      "cargo": {
        "args": [
          "build",
          "--manifest-path=./src-tauri/Cargo.toml",
          "--no-default-features"
        ]
      },
      // task for the `beforeDevCommand` if used, must be configured in `.vscode/tasks.json`
      "preLaunchTask": "ui:dev"
    },
    {
      "type": "lldb",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Tauri Production Debug",
      "cargo": {
        "args": ["build", "--release", "--manifest-path=./src-tauri/Cargo.toml"]
      },
      // task for the `beforeBuildCommand` if used, must be configured in `.vscode/tasks.json`
      "preLaunchTask": "ui:build"
    }
  ]
}
```

This uses `cargo` directly to build the Rust application and load it in both development and production modes.

Note that it does not use the Tauri CLI, so exclusive CLI features are not executed. The `beforeDevCommand` and `beforeBuildCommand` scripts must be executed beforehand or configured as a task in the `preLaunchTask` field. Below is an example `.vscode/tasks.json` file that has two tasks, one for a `beforeDevCommand` that spawns a development server and one for `beforeBuildCommand`:

```json title=".vscode/tasks.json"
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "ui:dev",
      "type": "shell",
      // `dev` keeps running in the background
      // ideally you should also configure a `problemMatcher`
      // see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_can-a-background-task-be-used-as-a-prelaunchtask-in-launchjson
      "isBackground": true,
      // change this to your `beforeDevCommand`:
      "command": "yarn",
      "args": ["dev"]
    },
    {
      "label": "ui:build",
      "type": "shell",
      // change this to your `beforeBuildCommand`:
      "command": "yarn",
      "args": ["build"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Now you can set breakpoints in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` or any other Rust file and start debugging by pressing `F5`.

## With Visual Studio Windows Debugger on Windows

Visual Studio Windows Debugger is a Windows-only debugger that is generally faster than [`vscode-lldb`] with better support for some Rust features such as enums.

### Prerequisites

Install the [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) extension and follow https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc#_prerequisites to install Visual Studio Windows Debugger.

### Configure launch.json and tasks.json

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch App Debug",
      "type": "cppvsdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      // change the exe name to your actual exe name
      // (to debug release builds, change `target/debug` to `release/debug`)
      "program": "${workspaceRoot}/src-tauri/target/debug/your-app-name-here.exe",
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "preLaunchTask": "ui:dev"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that it does not use the Tauri CLI, so exclusive CLI features are not executed. The `tasks.json` is the same as with `lldb`, except you need to add a config group and target your `preLaunchTask` from `launch.json` to it if you want it to always compile before launching.

Here is an example of running a dev server (equivalent of `beforeDevCommand`) and the compilation (`cargo build`) as a group, to use it, change the `preLaunchTask` config in `launch.json` to `dev` (or anything you named your group).

```json title=".vscode/tasks.json"
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "build:debug",
      "type": "cargo",
      "command": "build",
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}/src-tauri"
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "ui:dev",
      "type": "shell",
      // `dev` keeps running in the background
      // ideally you should also configure a `problemMatcher`
      // see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_can-a-background-task-be-used-as-a-prelaunchtask-in-launchjson
      "isBackground": true,
      // change this to your `beforeDevCommand`:
      "command": "yarn",
      "args": ["dev"]
    },
    {
      "label": "dev",
      "dependsOn": ["build:debug", "ui:dev"],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Plugin Development

{/* TODO: Add a CLI section */}

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

{/* TODO: Link to windowing system, commands for sending messages, and event system */}

:::tip[Plugin Development]

This guide is for developing Tauri plugins. If you're looking for a list of the currently available plugins and how to use them then visit the [Features and Recipes list](/plugin/).

:::

Plugins are able to hook into the Tauri lifecycle, expose Rust code that relies on the web view APIs, handle commands with Rust, Kotlin or Swift code, and much more.

Tauri offers a windowing system with web view functionality, a way to send messages between the Rust process and the web view, and an event system along with several tools to enhance the development experience. By design, the Tauri core does not contain features not needed by everyone. Instead it offers a mechanism to add external functionalities into a Tauri application called plugins.

A Tauri plugin is composed of a Cargo crate and an optional NPM package that provides API bindings for its commands and events. Additionally, a plugin project can include an Android library project and a Swift package for iOS. You can learn more about developing plugins for Android and iOS in the [Mobile Plugin Development guide](/develop/plugins/develop-mobile/).

{/* TODO: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7749 */}

## Naming Convention

Tauri plugins have a prefix followed by the plugin name. The plugin name is specified on the plugin configuration under [`tauri.conf.json > plugins`](/reference/config/#pluginconfig).

By default Tauri prefixes your plugin crate with `tauri-plugin-`. This helps your plugin to be discovered by the Tauri community and to be used with the Tauri CLI. When initializing a new plugin project, you must provide its name. The generated crate name will be `tauri-plugin-{plugin-name}` and the JavaScript NPM package name will be `tauri-plugin-{plugin-name}-api` (although we recommend using an [NPM scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes) if possible). The Tauri naming convention for NPM packages is `@scope-name/plugin-{plugin-name}`.

## Initialize Plugin Project

To bootstrap a new plugin project, run `plugin new`. If you do not need the NPM package, use the `--no-api` CLI flag. If you want to initialize the plugin with Android and/or iOS support, use the `--android` and/or `--ios` flags.

After installing, you can run the following to create a plugin project:

<CommandTabs npm="npx @tauri-apps/cli plugin new [name]" />

This will initialize the plugin at the directory `tauri-plugin-[name]` and, depending on the used CLI flags, the resulting project will look like this:

```
. tauri-plugin-[name]/
├── src/                - Rust code
│ ├── commands.rs       - Defines the commands the webview can use
| ├── desktop.rs        - Desktop implementation
| ├── error.rs          - Default error type to use in returned results
│ ├── lib.rs            - Re-exports appropriate implementation, setup state...
│ ├── mobile.rs         - Mobile implementation
│ └── models.rs         - Shared structs
├── permissions/        - This will host (generated) permission files for commands
├── android             - Android library
├── ios                 - Swift package
├── guest-js            - Source code of the JavaScript API bindings
├── dist-js             - Transpiled assets from guest-js
├── Cargo.toml          - Cargo crate metadata
└── package.json        - NPM package metadata
```

If you have an existing plugin and would like to add Android or iOS capabilities to it, you can use `plugin android add` and `plugin ios add` to bootstrap the mobile library projects and guide you through the changes needed.

## Mobile Plugin Development

Plugins can run native mobile code written in Kotlin (or Java) and Swift. The default plugin template includes an Android library project using Kotlin and a Swift package. It includes an example mobile command showing how to trigger its execution from Rust code.

Read more about developing plugins for mobile in the [Mobile Plugin Development guide](/develop/plugins/develop-mobile/).

## Plugin Configuration

In the Tauri application where the plugin is used, the plugin configuration is specified on `tauri.conf.json` where `plugin-name` is the name of the plugin:

```json
{
  "build": { ... },
  "tauri": { ... },
  "plugins": {
    "plugin-name": {
      "timeout": 30
    }
  }
}
```

The plugin's configuration is set on the `Builder` and is parsed at runtime. Here is an example of the `Config` struct being used to specify the plugin configuration:

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use tauri::plugin::{Builder, Runtime, TauriPlugin};
use serde::Deserialize;

// Define the plugin config
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Config {
  timeout: usize,
}

pub fn init<R: Runtime>() -> TauriPlugin<R, Config> {
  // Make the plugin config optional
  // by using `Builder::<R, Option<Config>>` instead
  Builder::<R, Config>::new("<plugin-name>")
    .setup(|app, api| {
      let timeout = api.config().timeout;
      Ok(())
    })
    .build()
}
```

## Lifecycle Events

Plugins can hook into several lifecycle events:

- [setup](#setup): Plugin is being initialized
- [on_navigation](#on_navigation): Web view is attempting to perform navigation
- [on_webview_ready](#on_webview_ready): New window is being created
- [on_event](#on_event): Event loop events
- [on_drop](#on_drop): Plugin is being deconstructed

There are additional [lifecycle events for mobile plugins](/develop/plugins/develop-mobile/#lifecycle-events).

### setup

- **When**: Plugin is being initialized
- **Why**: Register mobile plugins, manage state, run background tasks

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{Manager, plugin::Builder};
use std::{collections::HashMap, sync::Mutex, time::Duration};

struct DummyStore(Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>);

Builder::new("<plugin-name>")
  .setup(|app, api| {
    app.manage(DummyStore(Default::default()));

    let app_ = app.clone();
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
      loop {
        app_.emit("tick", ());
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
      }
    });

    Ok(())
  })
```

### on_navigation

- **When**: Web view is attempting to perform navigation
- **Why**: Validate the navigation or track URL changes

Returning `false` cancels the navigation.

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use tauri::plugin::Builder;

Builder::new("<plugin-name>")
  .on_navigation(|window, url| {
    println!("window {} is navigating to {}", window.label(), url);
    // Cancels the navigation if forbidden
    url.scheme() != "forbidden"
  })
```

### on_webview_ready

- **When**: New window has been created
- **Why**: Execute an initialization script for every window

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use tauri::plugin::Builder;

Builder::new("<plugin-name>")
  .on_webview_ready(|window| {
    window.listen("content-loaded", |event| {
      println!("webview content has been loaded");
    });
  })
```

### on_event

- **When**: Event loop events
- **Why**: Handle core events such as window events, menu events and application exit requested

With this lifecycle hook you can be notified of any event loop [events](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/enum.RunEvent.html).

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use std::{collections::HashMap, fs::write, sync::Mutex};
use tauri::{plugin::Builder, Manager, RunEvent};

struct DummyStore(Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>);

Builder::new("<plugin-name>")
  .setup(|app, _api| {
    app.manage(DummyStore(Default::default()));
    Ok(())
  })
  .on_event(|app, event| {
    match event {
      RunEvent::ExitRequested { api, .. } => {
        // user requested a window to be closed and there's no windows left

        // we can prevent the app from exiting:
        api.prevent_exit();
      }
      RunEvent::Exit => {
        // app is going to exit, you can cleanup here

        let store = app.state::<DummyStore>();
        write(
          app.path().app_local_data_dir().unwrap().join("store.json"),
          serde_json::to_string(&*store.0.lock().unwrap()).unwrap(),
        )
        .unwrap();
      }
      _ => {}
    }
  })
```

### on_drop

- **When**: Plugin is being deconstructed
- **Why**: Execute code when the plugin has been destroyed

See [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html) for more information.

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use tauri::plugin::Builder;

Builder::new("<plugin-name>")
  .on_drop(|app| {
    // plugin has been destroyed...
  })
```

## Exposing Rust APIs

The plugin APIs defined in the project's `desktop.rs` and `mobile.rs` are exported to the user as a struct with the same name as the plugin (in pascal case). When the plugin is setup, an instance of this struct is created and managed as a state so that users can retrieve it at any point in time with a `Manager` instance (such as `AppHandle`, `App`, or` Window`) through the extension trait defined in the plugin.

For example, the [`global-shortcut plugin`](/plugin/global-shortcut/) defines a `GlobalShortcut` struct that can be read by using the `global_shortcut` method of the `GlobalShortcutExt` trait:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri_plugin_global_shortcut::GlobalShortcutExt;

tauri::Builder::default()
  .plugin(tauri_plugin_global_shortcut::init())
  .setup(|app| {
    app.global_shortcut().register(...);
    Ok(())
  })
```

## Adding Commands

Commands are defined in the `commands.rs` file. They are regular Tauri applications commands. They can access the AppHandle and Window instances directly, access state, and take input the same way as application commands. Read the [Commands guide](/develop/calling-rust/) for more details on Tauri commands.

This command shows how to get access to the `AppHandle` and `Window` instance via dependency injection, and takes two input parameters (`on_progress` and `url`):

```rust title="src/commands.rs"
use tauri::{command, ipc::Channel, AppHandle, Runtime, Window};

#[command]
async fn upload<R: Runtime>(app: AppHandle<R>, window: Window<R>, on_progress: Channel, url: String) {
  // implement command logic here
  on_progress.send(100).unwrap();
}
```

To expose the command to the webview, you must hook into the `invoke_handler()` call in `lib.rs`:

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
Builder::new("<plugin-name>")
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![commands::upload])
```

Define a binding function in `webview-src/index.ts` so that plugin users can easily call the command in JavaScript:

```js name="webview-src/index.ts"
import { invoke, Channel } from '@tauri-apps/api/core'

export async function upload(url: string, onProgressHandler: (progress: number) => void): Promise<void> {
  const onProgress = new Channel<number>()
  onProgress.onmessage = onProgressHandler
  await invoke('plugin:<plugin-name>|upload', { url, onProgress })
}
```

Be sure to build the TypeScript code prior to testing it.

### Command Permissions

By default your commands are not accessible by the frontend. If you try to execute one of them, you will get a denied error rejection.
To actually expose commands, you also need to define permissions that allow each command.

#### Permission Files

Permissions are defined as JSON or TOML files inside the `permissions` directory. Each file can define a list of permissions, a list of permission sets and your plugin's default permission.

##### Permissions

A permission describes privileges of your plugin commands. It can allow or deny a list of commands and associate command-specific and global scopes.

```toml title="permissions/start-server.toml"
"$schema" = "schemas/schema.json"

[[permission]]
identifier = "allow-start-server"
description = "Enables the start_server command."
commands.allow = ["start_server"]

[[permission]]
identifier = "deny-start-server"
description = "Denies the start_server command."
commands.deny = ["start_server"]
```

##### Scope

Scopes allow your plugin to define deeper restrictions to individual commands.
Each permission can define a list of scope objects that define something to be allowed or denied either specific to a command or globally to the plugin.

Let's define an example struct that will hold scope data for a list of binaries a `shell` plugin is allowed to spawn:

```rust title="src/scope.rs"
#[derive(Debug, schemars::JsonSchema)]
pub struct Entry {
    pub binary: String,
}
```

###### Command Scope

Your plugin consumer can define a scope for a specific command in their capability file (see the [documentation](/reference/acl/scope/)).
You can read the command-specific scope with the [`tauri::ipc::CommandScope`](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/ipc/struct.CommandScope.html) struct:

```rust title="src/commands.rs"
use tauri::ipc::CommandScope;
use crate::scope::Entry;

async fn spawn<R: tauri::Runtime>(app: tauri::AppHandle<R>, command_scope: CommandScope<'_, Entry>) -> Result<()> {
  let allowed = command_scope.allows();
  let denied = command_scope.denies();
  todo!()
}
```

###### Global Scope

When a permission does not define any commands to be allowed or denied, it's considered a scope permission and it should only define a global scope for your plugin:

```toml title="permissions/spawn-node.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "allow-spawn-node"
description = "This scope permits spawning the `node` binary."

[[permission.scope.allow]]
binary = "node"
```

You can read the global scope with the [`tauri::ipc::GlobalScope`](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/ipc/struct.GlobalScope.html) struct:

```rust title="src/commands.rs"
use tauri::ipc::GlobalScope;
use crate::scope::Entry;

async fn spawn<R: tauri::Runtime>(app: tauri::AppHandle<R>, scope: GlobalScope<'_, Entry>) -> Result<()> {
  let allowed = scope.allows();
  let denied = scope.denies();
  todo!()
}
```

:::note
We recommend checking both global and command scopes for flexibility
:::

###### Schema

The scope entry requires the `schemars` dependency to generate a JSON schema so the plugin consumers know the format of the scope and have autocomplete in their IDEs.

To define the schema, first add the dependency to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
# we need to add schemars to both dependencies and build-dependencies because the scope.rs module is shared between the app code and build script
[dependencies]
schemars = "0.8"

[build-dependencies]
schemars = "0.8"
```

In your build script, add the following code:

```rust title="build.rs"
#[path = "src/scope.rs"]
mod scope;

const COMMANDS: &[&str] = &[];

fn main() {
    tauri_plugin::Builder::new(COMMANDS)
        .global_scope_schema(schemars::schema_for!(scope::Entry))
        .build();
}
```

##### Permission Sets

Permission sets are groups of individual permissions that helps users manage your plugin with a higher level of abstraction.
For instance if a single API uses multiple commands or if there's a logical connection between a collection of commands, you should define a set containing them:

```toml title="permissions/websocket.toml"
"$schema" = "schemas/schema.json"
[[set]]
identifier = "allow-websocket"
description = "Allows connecting and sending messages through a WebSocket"
permissions = ["allow-connect", "allow-send"]
```

##### Default Permission

The default permission is a special permission set with identifier `default`. It's recommended that you enable required commands by default.
For instance the `http` plugin is useless without the `request` command allowed:

```toml title="permissions/default.toml"
"$schema" = "schemas/schema.json"
[default]
description = "Allows making HTTP requests"
permissions = ["allow-request"]
```

#### Autogenerated Permissions

The easiest way to define permissions for each of your commands is to use the autogeneration option defined in your plugin's build script defined in the `build.rs` file.
Inside the `COMMANDS` const, define the list of commands in snake_case (should match the command function name) and Tauri will automatically generate an `allow-$commandname` and a `deny-$commandname` permissions.

The following example generates the `allow-upload` and `deny-upload` permissions:

```rust title="src/commands.rs"
const COMMANDS: &[&str] = &["upload"];

fn main() {
    tauri_plugin::Builder::new(COMMANDS).build();
}
```

See the [Permissions Overview](/security/permissions/) documentation for more information.

## Managing State

A plugin can manage state in the same way a Tauri application does. Read the [State Management guide](/develop/state-management/) for more information.

# Mobile Plugin Development

:::tip[Plugin Development]

Be sure that you're familiar with the concepts covered in the [Plugin Development guide](/develop/plugins/) as many concepts in this guide build on top of foundations covered there.

:::

Plugins can run native mobile code written in Kotlin (or Java) and Swift. The default plugin template includes an Android library project using Kotlin and a Swift package including an example mobile command showing how to trigger its execution from Rust code.

## Initialize Plugin Project

Follow the steps in the [Plugin Development guide](/develop/plugins/#initialize-plugin-project) to initialize a new plugin project.

If you have an existing plugin and would like to add Android or iOS capabilities to it, you can use `plugin android init` and `plugin ios init` to bootstrap the mobile library projects and guide you through the changes needed.

The default plugin template splits the plugin's implementation into two separate modules: `desktop.rs` and `mobile.rs`.

The desktop implementation uses Rust code to implement a functionality, while the mobile implementation sends a message to the native mobile code to execute a function and get a result back. If shared logic is needed across both implementations, it can be defined in `lib.rs`:

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use tauri::Runtime;

impl<R: Runtime> <plugin-name><R> {
  pub fn do_something(&self) {
    // do something that is a shared implementation between desktop and mobile
  }
}
```

This implementation simplifies the process of sharing an API that can be used both by commands and Rust code.

### Develop an Android Plugin

A Tauri plugin for Android is defined as a Kotlin class that extends `app.tauri.plugin.Plugin` and is annotated with `app.tauri.annotation.TauriPlugin`. Each method annotated with `app.tauri.annotation.Command` can be called by Rust or JavaScript.

Tauri uses Kotlin by default for the Android plugin implementation, but you can switch to Java if you prefer. After generating a plugin, right click the Kotlin plugin class in Android Studio and select the "Convert Kotlin file to Java file" option from the menu. Android Studio will guide you through the project migration to Java.

### Develop an iOS Plugin

A Tauri plugin for iOS is defined as a Swift class that extends the `Plugin` class from the `Tauri` package. Each function with the `@objc` attribute and the `(_ invoke: Invoke)` parameter (for example `@objc private func download(_ invoke: Invoke) { }`) can be called by Rust or JavaScript.

The plugin is defined as a [Swift package](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) so that you can use its package manager to manage dependencies.

## Plugin Configuration

Refer to the [Plugin Configuration section](/develop/plugins/#plugin-configuration) of the Plugin Development guide for more details on developing plugin configurations.

The plugin instance on mobile has a getter for the plugin configuration:

<Tabs syncKey="mobileOs">
<TabItem label="Android">

```kotlin
import android.app.Activity
import android.webkit.WebView
import app.tauri.annotation.TauriPlugin
import app.tauri.annotation.InvokeArg

@InvokeArg
class Config {
    var timeout: Int? = 3000
}

@TauriPlugin
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) {
  private var timeout: Int? = 3000

  override fun load(webView: WebView) {
    getConfig(Config::class.java).let {
       this.timeout = it.timeout
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="iOS">

```swift
struct Config: Decodable {
  let timeout: Int?
}

class ExamplePlugin: Plugin {
  var timeout: Int? = 3000

  @objc public override func load(webview: WKWebView) {
    do {
      let config = try parseConfig(Config.self)
      self.timeout = config.timeout
    } catch {}
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Lifecycle Events

Plugins can hook into several lifecycle events:

- [load](#load): When the plugin is loaded into the web view
- [onNewIntent](#onnewintent): Android only, when the activity is re-launched

There are also the additional [lifecycle events for plugins](/develop/plugins/#lifecycle-events) in the Plugin Development guide.

### load

- **When**: When the plugin is loaded into the web view
- **Why**: Execute plugin initialization code

<Tabs syncKey="mobileOs">
<TabItem label="Android">

```kotlin
import android.app.Activity
import android.webkit.WebView
import app.tauri.annotation.TauriPlugin

@TauriPlugin
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) {
  override fun load(webView: WebView) {
    // perform plugin setup here
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="iOS">

```swift
class ExamplePlugin: Plugin {
  @objc public override func load(webview: WKWebView) {
    let timeout = self.config["timeout"] as? Int ?? 30
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### onNewIntent

**Note**: This is only available on Android.

- **When**: When the activity is re-launched. See [Activity#onNewIntent](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)>) for more information.
- **Why**: Handle application re-launch such as when a notification is clicked or a deep link is accessed.

```kotlin
import android.app.Activity
import android.content.Intent
import app.tauri.annotation.TauriPlugin

@TauriPlugin
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) {
  override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent) {
    // handle new intent event
  }
}
```

## Adding Mobile Commands

There is a plugin class inside the respective mobile projects where commands can be defined that can be called by the Rust code:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="mobileOs">
<TabItem label="Android">

```kotlin
import android.app.Activity
import app.tauri.annotation.Command
import app.tauri.annotation.TauriPlugin

@TauriPlugin
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) {
  @Command
  fun openCamera(invoke: Invoke) {
    val ret = JSObject()
    ret.put("path", "/path/to/photo.jpg")
    invoke.resolve(ret)
  }
}
```

If you want to use a Kotlin `suspend` function, you need to use a custom coroutine scope

```kotlin
import android.app.Activity
import app.tauri.annotation.Command
import app.tauri.annotation.TauriPlugin

// Change to Dispatchers.IO if it is intended for fetching data
val scope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default + SupervisorJob())

@TauriPlugin
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) {
  @Command
  fun openCamera(invoke: Invoke) {
    scope.launch {
      openCameraInner(invoke)
    }
  }

  private suspend fun openCameraInner(invoke: Invoke) {
    val ret = JSObject()
    ret.put("path", "/path/to/photo.jpg")
    invoke.resolve(ret)
  }
}
```

:::note
On Android native commands are scheduled on the main thread. Performing long-running operations will cause the UI to freeze and potentially "Application Not Responding" (ANR) error.

If you need to wait for some blocking IO, you can launch a corouting like that:

```kotlin
CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
  val result = myLongRunningOperation()
  invoke.resolve(result)
}
```

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="iOS">

```swift
class ExamplePlugin: Plugin {
	@objc public func openCamera(_ invoke: Invoke) throws {
    invoke.resolve(["path": "/path/to/photo.jpg"])
	}
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Use the [`tauri::plugin::PluginHandle`](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/plugin/struct.PluginHandle.html) to call a mobile command from Rust:

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use tauri::Runtime;

#[derive(Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct CameraRequest {
  quality: usize,
  allow_edit: bool,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct Photo {
  path: PathBuf,
}


impl<R: Runtime> <plugin-name;pascal-case><R> {
  pub fn open_camera(&self, payload: CameraRequest) -> crate::Result<Photo> {
    self
      .0
      .run_mobile_plugin("openCamera", payload)
      .map_err(Into::into)
  }
}
```

## Command Arguments

Arguments are serialized to commands and can be parsed on the mobile plugin with the `Invoke::parseArgs` function, taking a class describing the argument object.

### Android

On Android, the arguments are defined as a class annotated with `@app.tauri.annotation.InvokeArg`. Inner objects must also be annotated:

```kotlin
import android.app.Activity
import android.webkit.WebView
import app.tauri.annotation.Command
import app.tauri.annotation.InvokeArg
import app.tauri.annotation.TauriPlugin

@InvokeArg
internal class OpenAppArgs {
  lateinit var name: String
  var timeout: Int? = null
}

@InvokeArg
internal class OpenArgs {
  lateinit var requiredArg: String
  var allowEdit: Boolean = false
  var quality: Int = 100
  var app: OpenAppArgs? = null
}

@TauriPlugin
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) {
  @Command
  fun openCamera(invoke: Invoke) {
    val args = invoke.parseArgs(OpenArgs::class.java)
  }
}
```

:::note
Optional arguments are defined as `var <argumentName>: Type? = null`

Arguments with default values are defined as `var <argumentName>: Type = <default-value>`

Required arguments are defined as `lateinit var <argumentName>: Type`
:::

### iOS

On iOS, the arguments are defined as a class that inherits `Decodable`. Inner objects must also inherit the Decodable protocol:

```swift
class OpenAppArgs: Decodable {
  let name: String
  var timeout: Int?
}

class OpenArgs: Decodable {
  let requiredArg: String
  var allowEdit: Bool?
  var quality: UInt8?
  var app: OpenAppArgs?
}

class ExamplePlugin: Plugin {
	@objc public func openCamera(_ invoke: Invoke) throws {
    let args = try invoke.parseArgs(OpenArgs.self)

    invoke.resolve(["path": "/path/to/photo.jpg"])
	}
}
```

:::note
Optional arguments are defined as `var <argumentName>: Type?`

Arguments with default values are **NOT** supported.
Use a nullable type and set the default value on the command function instead.

Required arguments are defined as `let <argumentName>: Type`
:::

## Permissions

If a plugin requires permissions from the end user, Tauri simplifies the process of checking and requesting permissions.

<Tabs syncKey="mobileOs">
<TabItem label="Android">

First define the list of permissions needed and an alias to identify each group in code. This is done inside the `TauriPlugin` annotation:

```kotlin
@TauriPlugin(
  permissions = [
    Permission(strings = [Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS], alias = "postNotification")
  ]
)
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) { }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="iOS">

First override the `checkPermissions` and `requestPermissions` functions:

```swift
class ExamplePlugin: Plugin {
  @objc open func checkPermissions(_ invoke: Invoke) {
    invoke.resolve(["postNotification": "prompt"])
  }

  @objc public override func requestPermissions(_ invoke: Invoke) {
    // request permissions here
    // then resolve the request
    invoke.resolve(["postNotification": "granted"])
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Tauri automatically implements two commands for the plugin: `checkPermissions` and `requestPermissions`.
Those commands can be directly called from JavaScript or Rust:

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { invoke, PermissionState } from '@tauri-apps/api/core'

interface Permissions {
  postNotification: PermissionState
}

// check permission state
const permission = await invoke<Permissions>('plugin:<plugin-name>|checkPermissions')

if (permission.postNotification === 'prompt-with-rationale') {
  // show information to the user about why permission is needed
}

// request permission
if (permission.postNotification.startsWith('prompt')) {
  const state = await invoke<Permissions>('plugin:<plugin-name>|requestPermissions', { permissions: ['postNotification'] })
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use tauri::{plugin::PermissionState, Runtime};

#[derive(Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct PermissionResponse {
  pub post_notification: PermissionState,
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct RequestPermission {
  post_notification: bool,
}

impl<R: Runtime> Notification<R> {
  pub fn request_post_notification_permission(&self) -> crate::Result<PermissionState> {
    self.0
      .run_mobile_plugin::<PermissionResponse>("requestPermissions", RequestPermission { post_notification: true })
      .map(|r| r.post_notification)
      .map_err(Into::into)
  }

  pub fn check_permissions(&self) -> crate::Result<PermissionResponse> {
    self.0
      .run_mobile_plugin::<PermissionResponse>("checkPermissions", ())
      .map_err(Into::into)
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Plugin Events

{/* TODO: Is this section a duplicate of Lifecycle Events above? */}

Plugins can emit events at any point of time using the `trigger` function:

<Tabs syncKey="mobileOs">
<TabItem label="Android">

```kotlin
@TauriPlugin
class ExamplePlugin(private val activity: Activity): Plugin(activity) {
    override fun load(webView: WebView) {
      trigger("load", JSObject())
    }

    override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent) {
      // handle new intent event
      if (intent.action == Intent.ACTION_VIEW) {
        val data = intent.data.toString()
        val event = JSObject()
        event.put("data", data)
        trigger("newIntent", event)
      }
    }

    @Command
    fun openCamera(invoke: Invoke) {
      val payload = JSObject()
      payload.put("open", true)
      trigger("camera", payload)
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="iOS">

```swift
class ExamplePlugin: Plugin {
  @objc public override func load(webview: WKWebView) {
    trigger("load", data: [:])
  }

  @objc public func openCamera(_ invoke: Invoke) {
    trigger("camera", data: ["open": true])
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The helper functions can then be called from the NPM package by using the [`addPluginListener`](/reference/javascript/api/namespacecore/#addpluginlistener) helper function:

```javascript
import { addPluginListener, PluginListener } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';

export async function onRequest(
	handler: (url: string) => void
): Promise<PluginListener> {
	return await addPluginListener(
		'<plugin-name>',
		'event-name',
		handler
	);
}
```

# Embedding Additional Files

You may need to include additional files in your application bundle that aren't part of your frontend (your `frontendDist`) directly or which are too big to be inlined into the binary. We call these files `resources`.

To bundle the files of your choice, you can add the `resources` property to the `bundle` object in your `tauri.conf.json` file.

See more about `tauri.conf.json` configuration [here][tauri.bundle].

`resources` expects a list of strings targeting files or directories either with absolute or relative paths. It supports glob patterns in case you need to include multiple files from a directory.

Here is a sample to illustrate the configuration. This is not a complete `tauri.conf.json` file:

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "bundle": {
    "resources": [
      "/absolute/path/to/textfile.txt",
      "relative/path/to/jsonfile.json",
      "resources/**/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

Alternatively the `resources` config also accepts a map object if you want to change where the files will be copied to. Here is a sample that shows how to include files from different sources into the same `resources` folder:

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "bundle": {
    "resources": {
      "/absolute/path/to/textfile.txt": "resources/textfile.txt",
      "relative/path/to/jsonfile.json": "resources/jsonfile.json",
      "resources/**/*": "resources/"
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

In Tauri's [permission system](/reference/acl/capability/), absolute paths and paths containing parent components (`../`) can only be allowed via `"$RESOURCE/**"`. Relative paths like `"path/to/file.txt"` can be allowed explicitly via `"$RESOURCE/path/to/file.txt"`.

:::

## Source path syntax

In the following explanations "target resource directory" is either the value after the colon in the object notation, or a reconstruction of the original file paths in the array notation.

- `"dir/file.txt"`: copies the `file.txt` file into the target resource directory.
- `"dir/"`: copies all files **and directories** _recursively_ into the target resource directory. Use this if you also want to preserve the file system structure of your files and directories.
- `"dir/*"`: copies all files in the `dir` directory _non-recursively_ (sub-directories will be ignored) into the target resource directory.
- `"dir/**`: throws an error because `**` only matches directories and therefore no files can be found.
- `"dir/**/*"`: copies all files in the `dir` directory _recursively_ (all files in `dir/` and all files in all sub-directories) into the target resource directory.
- `"dir/**/**`: throws an error because `**` only matches directories and therefore no files can be found.

## Accessing files in Rust

In this example we want to bundle additional i18n json files that look like this:

```json title=de.json
{
  "hello": "Guten Tag!",
  "bye": "Auf Wiedersehen!"
}
```

In this case, we store these files in a `lang` directory next to the `tauri.conf.json`.
For this we add `"lang/*"` to `resources` as shown above.

On the Rust side, you need an instance of the [`PathResolver`] which you can get from [`App`] and [`AppHandle`]:

```rust
tauri::Builder::default()
  .setup(|app| {
    // The path specified must follow the same syntax as defined in
    // `tauri.conf.json > bundle > resources`
    let resource_path = app.path().resolve("lang/de.json", BaseDirectory::Resource)?;

    let file = std::fs::File::open(&resource_path).unwrap();
    let lang_de: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_reader(file).unwrap();

    // This will print 'Guten Tag!' to the terminal
    println!("{}", lang_de.get("hello").unwrap());

    Ok(())
  })
```

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn hello(handle: tauri::AppHandle) -> String {
    let resource_path = handle.path().resolve("lang/de.json", BaseDirectory::Resource)?;

    let file = std::fs::File::open(&resource_path).unwrap();
    let lang_de: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_reader(file).unwrap();

    lang_de.get("hello").unwrap()
}
```

## Accessing files in JavaScript

For the JavaScript side, you can either use a command like the one above and call it through `await invoke('hello')` or access the files using the [`plugin-fs`]

When using the [`plugin-fs`], addition from the [basic setup], you'll also need to configure the access control list to enable any [`plugin-fs`] APIs you will need as well as permissions to access the `$RESOURCE` folder:

# Embedding External Binaries

You may need to embed external binaries to add additional functionality to your application or prevent users from installing additional dependencies (e.g., Node.js or Python). We call this binary a `sidecar`.

Binaries are executables written in any programming language. Common use cases are Python CLI applications or API servers bundled using `pyinstaller`.

To bundle the binaries of your choice, you can add the `externalBin` property to the `tauri > bundle` object in your `tauri.conf.json`.
The `externalBin` configuration expects a list of strings targeting binaries either with absolute or relative paths.

Here is a Tauri configuration snippet to illustrate a sidecar configuration:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "externalBin": [
      "/absolute/path/to/sidecar",
      "../relative/path/to/binary",
      "binaries/my-sidecar"
    ]
  }
}
```

:::note

The relative paths are relative to the `tauri.conf.json` file which is in the `src-tauri` directory.
So `binaries/my-sidecar` would represent `<PROJECT ROOT>/src-tauri/binaries/my-sidecar`.

:::

To make the external binary work on each supported architecture, a binary with the same name and a `-$TARGET_TRIPLE` suffix must exist on the specified path.
For instance, `"externalBin": ["binaries/my-sidecar"]` requires a `src-tauri/binaries/my-sidecar-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` executable on Linux or `src-tauri/binaries/my-sidecar-aarch64-apple-darwin` on Mac OS with Apple Silicon.

You can find your **current** platform's `-$TARGET_TRIPLE` suffix by looking at the `host:` property reported by the following command:

```sh
rustc -Vv
```

If the `grep` and `cut` commands are available, as they should on most Unix systems, you can extract the target triple directly with the following command:

```shell
rustc -Vv | grep host | cut -f2 -d' '
```

On Windows you can use PowerShell instead:

```powershell
rustc -Vv | Select-String "host:" | ForEach-Object {$_.Line.split(" ")[1]}
```

Here's a Node.js script to append the target triple to a binary:

```javascript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';
import fs from 'fs';

const extension = process.platform === 'win32' ? '.exe' : '';

const rustInfo = execSync('rustc -vV');
const targetTriple = /host: (\S+)/g.exec(rustInfo)[1];
if (!targetTriple) {
  console.error('Failed to determine platform target triple');
}
fs.renameSync(
  `src-tauri/binaries/sidecar${extension}`,
  `src-tauri/binaries/sidecar-${targetTriple}${extension}`
);
```

Note that this script will not work if you compile for a different architecture than the one its running on,
so only use it as a starting point for your own build scripts.

## Running it from Rust

:::note
Please follow the [shell plugin guide](/plugin/shell/) first to set up and initialize the plugin correctly.
Without the plugin being initialized and configured the example won't work.
:::

On the Rust side, import the `tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt` trait and call the `shell().sidecar()` function on the AppHandle:

```rust
use tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt;
use tauri_plugin_shell::process::CommandEvent;

let sidecar_command = app.shell().sidecar("my-sidecar").unwrap();
let (mut rx, mut _child) = sidecar_command
  .spawn()
  .expect("Failed to spawn sidecar");

tauri::async_runtime::spawn(async move {
  // read events such as stdout
  while let Some(event) = rx.recv().await {
    if let CommandEvent::Stdout(line_bytes) = event {
      let line = String::from_utf8_lossy(&line_bytes);
      window
        .emit("message", Some(format!("'{}'", line)))
        .expect("failed to emit event");
      // write to stdin
      child.write("message from Rust\n".as_bytes()).unwrap();
    }
  }
});
```

:::note
The `sidecar()` function expects just the filename, NOT the whole path configured in the `externalBin` array.

Given the following configuration:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "externalBin": ["binaries/app", "my-sidecar", "../scripts/sidecar"]
  }
}
```

The appropriate way to execute the sidecar is by calling `app.shell().sidecar(name)` where `name` is either `"app"`, `"my-sidecar"` or `"sidecar"`
instead of `"binaries/app"` for instance.

:::

You can place this code inside a Tauri command to easily pass the AppHandle or you can store a reference to the AppHandle in the builder script to access it elsewhere in your application.

## Running it from JavaScript

When running the sidecar, Tauri requires you to give the sidecar permission to run the `execute` or `spawn` method on the child process. To grant this permission, go to the file `<PROJECT ROOT>/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` and add the section below to the permissions array. Don't forget to name your sidecar according to the relative path mentioned earlier.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json" ins={4-13}
{
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    {
      "identifier": "shell:allow-execute",
      "allow": [
        {
          "name": "binaries/app",
          "sidecar": true
        }
      ]
    },
    "shell:allow-open"
  ]
}
```

:::note

The `shell:allow-execute` identifier is used because the sidecar's child process will be started using the `command.execute()` method. To run it with `command.spawn()`, you need to change the identifier to `shell:allow-spawn` or add another entry to the array with the same structure as the one above, but with the identifier set to `shell:allow-spawn`.

:::

In the JavaScript code, import the `Command` class from the `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` module and use the `sidecar` static method.

```javascript
import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-shell';
const command = Command.sidecar('binaries/my-sidecar');
const output = await command.execute();
```

:::note
The string provided to `Command.sidecar` must match one of the strings defined in the `externalBin` configuration array.
:::

## Passing arguments

You can pass arguments to Sidecar commands just like you would for running normal [Command][std::process::Command].

Arguments can be either **static** (e.g. `-o` or `serve`) or **dynamic** (e.g. `<file_path>` or `localhost:<PORT>`). A value of `true` will allow any arguments to be passed to the command. `false` will disable all arguments. If neither `true` or `false` is set, you define the arguments in the exact order in which you'd call them. Static arguments are defined as-is, while dynamic arguments can be defined using a regular expression.

First, define the arguments that need to be passed to the sidecar command in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json" ins={8-25}
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "default",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    {
      "identifier": "shell:allow-execute",
      "allow": [
        {
          "args": [
            "arg1",
            "-a",
            "--arg2",
            {
              "validator": "\\S+"
            }
          ],
          "name": "binaries/my-sidecar",
          "sidecar": true
        }
      ]
    },
    "shell:allow-open"
  ]
}
```

:::note
If you are migrating from Tauri v1, the `migrate` command in Tauri v2 CLI should take care of this for you. Read [Automated Migration](/start/migrate/from-tauri-1/#automated-migration) for more.
:::

Then, to call the sidecar command, simply pass in **all** the arguments as an array.

In Rust:

```rust
use tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt;
#[tauri::command]
async fn call_my_sidecar(app: tauri::AppHandle) {
  let sidecar_command = app
    .shell()
    .sidecar("my-sidecar")
    .unwrap()
    .args(["arg1", "-a", "--arg2", "any-string-that-matches-the-validator"]);
  let (mut _rx, mut _child) = sidecar_command.spawn().unwrap();
}
```

In JavaScript:

```javascript
import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-shell';
// notice that the args array matches EXACTLY what is specified in `capabilities/default.json`.
const command = Command.sidecar('binaries/my-sidecar', [
  'arg1',
  '-a',
  '--arg2',
  'any-string-that-matches-the-validator',
]);
const output = await command.execute();
```

[std::process::Command]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html

# State Management

In a Tauri application, you often need to keep track of the current state of your application or manage the lifecycle of things associated with it. Tauri provides an easy way to manage the state of your application using the [`Manager`] API, and read it when commands are called.

Here is a simple example:

```rust
use tauri::{Builder, Manager};

struct AppData {
  welcome_message: &'static str,
}

fn main() {
  Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
      app.manage(AppData {
        welcome_message: "Welcome to Tauri!",
      });
      Ok(())
    })
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .unwrap();
}
```

You can later access your state with any type that implements the [`Manager`] trait, for example the [`App`] instance:

```rust
let data = app.state::<AppData>();
```

For more info, including accessing state in commands, see the [Accessing State](#accessing-state) section.

## Mutability

In Rust, you cannot directly mutate values which are shared between multiple threads or when ownership is controlled through a shared pointer such as [`Arc`] (or Tauri's [`State`]). Doing so could cause data races (for example, two writes happening simultaneously).

To work around this, you can use a concept known as [interior mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html). For example, the standard library's [`Mutex`] can be used to wrap your state. This allows you to lock the value when you need to modify it, and unlock it when you are done.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

use tauri::{Builder, Manager};

#[derive(Default)]
struct AppState {
  counter: u32,
}

fn main() {
  Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
      app.manage(Mutex::new(AppState::default()));
      Ok(())
    })
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .unwrap();
}
```

The state can now be modified by locking the mutex:

```rust
let state = app.state::<Mutex<AppState>>();

// Lock the mutex to get mutable access:
let mut state = state.lock().unwrap();

// Modify the state:
state.counter += 1;
```

At the end of the scope, or when the `MutexGuard` is otherwise dropped, the mutex is unlocked automatically so that other parts of your application can access and mutate the data within.

### When to use an async mutex

To quote the [Tokio documentation](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html#which-kind-of-mutex-should-you-use), it's often fine to use the standard library's [`Mutex`] instead of an async mutex such as the one Tokio provides:

> Contrary to popular belief, it is ok and often preferred to use the ordinary Mutex from the standard library in asynchronous code ... The primary use case for the async mutex is to provide shared mutable access to IO resources such as a database connection.

It's a good idea to read the linked documentation fully to understand the trade-offs between the two. One reason you _would_ need an async mutex is if you need to hold the `MutexGuard` across await points.

### Do you need `Arc`?

It's common to see [`Arc`] used in Rust to share ownership of a value across multiple threads (usually paired with a [`Mutex`] in the form of `Arc<Mutex<T>>`). However, you don't need to use [`Arc`] for things stored in [`State`] because Tauri will do this for you.

In case `State`'s lifetime requirements prevent you from moving your state into a new thread you can instead move an `AppHandle` into the thread and then retrieve your state as shown below in the "[Access state with the Manager trait](#access-state-with-the-manager-trait)" section. `AppHandle`s are deliberately cheap to clone for use-cases like this.

## Accessing State

### Access state in commands

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn increase_counter(state: State<'_, Mutex<AppState>>) -> u32 {
  let mut state = state.lock().unwrap();
  state.counter += 1;
  state.counter
}
```

For more information on commands, see [Calling Rust from the Frontend](/develop/calling-rust/).

#### Async commands

If you are using `async` commands and want to use Tokio's async [`Mutex`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html), you can set it up the same way and access the state like this:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn increase_counter(state: State<'_, Mutex<AppState>>) -> Result<u32, ()> {
  let mut state = state.lock().await;
  state.counter += 1;
  Ok(state.counter)
}
```

Note that the return type must be [`Result`] if you use asynchronous commands.

### Access state with the [`Manager`] trait

Sometimes you may need to access the state outside of commands, such as in a different thread or in an event handler like `on_window_event`. In such cases, you can use the `state()` method of types that implement the [`Manager`] trait (such as the `AppHandle`) to get the state:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use tauri::{Builder, Window, WindowEvent, Manager};

#[derive(Default)]
struct AppState {
  counter: u32,
}

// In an event handler:
fn on_window_event(window: &Window, _event: &WindowEvent) {
    // Get a handle to the app so we can get the global state.
    let app_handle = window.app_handle();
    let state = app_handle.state::<Mutex<AppState>>();

    // Lock the mutex to mutably access the state.
    let mut state = state.lock().unwrap();
    state.counter += 1;
}

fn main() {
  Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
      app.manage(Mutex::new(AppState::default()));
      Ok(())
    })
    .on_window_event(on_window_event)
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .unwrap();
}
```

This method is useful when you cannot rely on command injection. For example, if you need to move the state into a thread where using an `AppHandle` is easier, or if you are not in a command context.

## Mismatching Types

:::caution
If you use the wrong type for the [`State`] parameter, you will get a runtime panic instead of compile time error.

For example, if you use `State<'_, AppState>` instead of `State<'_, Mutex<AppState>>`, there won't be any state managed with that type.
:::

If you prefer, you can wrap your state with a type alias to prevent this mistake:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

#[derive(Default)]
struct AppStateInner {
  counter: u32,
}

type AppState = Mutex<AppStateInner>;
```

However, make sure to use the type alias as it is, and not wrap it in a [`Mutex`] a second time, otherwise you will run into the same issue.

# Tests

Tauri offers support for both unit and integration testing utilizing a mock runtime. Under the mock runtime, native
webview libraries are not executed. [See more about the mock runtime here].

Tauri also provides support for end-to-end testing support utilizing the WebDriver protocol. Both desktop and mobile
work with it, except for macOS which does not provide a desktop WebDriver client. [See more about WebDriver support here].

We offer [tauri-action] to help run GitHub actions, but any sort of CI/CD runner can be used with Tauri as long as each
platform has the required libraries installed to compile against.

# Mock Tauri APIs

When writing your frontend tests, having a "fake" Tauri environment to simulate windows or intercept IPC calls is common, so-called _mocking_.
The [`@tauri-apps/api/mocks`] module provides some helpful tools to make this easier for you:

:::caution

Remember to clear mocks after each test run to undo mock state changes between runs! See [`clearMocks()`] docs for more info.

:::

## IPC Requests

Most commonly, you want to intercept IPC requests; this can be helpful in a variety of situations:

- Ensure the correct backend calls are made
- Simulate different results from backend functions

Tauri provides the mockIPC function to intercept IPC requests. You can find more about the specific API in detail [here][`mockipc()`].

:::note

The following examples use [Vitest], but you can use any other frontend testing library such as jest.

:::

```javascript
import { beforeAll, expect, test } from "vitest";
import { randomFillSync } from "crypto";

import { mockIPC } from "@tauri-apps/api/mocks";
import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core";

// jsdom doesn't come with a WebCrypto implementation
beforeAll(() => {
  Object.defineProperty(window, 'crypto', {
    value: {
      // @ts-ignore
      getRandomValues: (buffer) => {
        return randomFillSync(buffer);
      },
    },
  });
});


test("invoke simple", async () => {
  mockIPC((cmd, args) => {
    // simulated rust command called "add" that just adds two numbers
    if(cmd === "add") {
      return (args.a as number) + (args.b as number);
    }
  });
});
```

Sometimes you want to track more information about an IPC call; how many times was the command invoked? Was it invoked at all?
You can use [`mockIPC()`] with other spying and mocking tools to test this:

```javascript
import { beforeAll, expect, test, vi } from "vitest";
import { randomFillSync } from "crypto";

import { mockIPC } from "@tauri-apps/api/mocks";
import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core";

// jsdom doesn't come with a WebCrypto implementation
beforeAll(() => {
  Object.defineProperty(window, 'crypto', {
    value: {
      // @ts-ignore
      getRandomValues: (buffer) => {
        return randomFillSync(buffer);
      },
    },
  });
});


test("invoke", async () => {
  mockIPC((cmd, args) => {
    // simulated rust command called "add" that just adds two numbers
    if(cmd === "add") {
      return (args.a as number) + (args.b as number);
    }
  });

  // we can use the spying tools provided by vitest to track the mocked function
  const spy = vi.spyOn(window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__, "invoke");

  expect(invoke("add", { a: 12, b: 15 })).resolves.toBe(27);
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

To mock IPC requests to a sidecar or shell command you need to grab the ID of the event handler when `spawn()` or `execute()` is called and use this ID to emit events the backend would send back:

```javascript
mockIPC(async (cmd, args) => {
  if (args.message.cmd === 'execute') {
    const eventCallbackId = `_${args.message.onEventFn}`;
    const eventEmitter = window[eventCallbackId];

    // 'Stdout' event can be called multiple times
    eventEmitter({
      event: 'Stdout',
      payload: 'some data sent from the process',
    });

    // 'Terminated' event must be called at the end to resolve the promise
    eventEmitter({
      event: 'Terminated',
      payload: {
        code: 0,
        signal: 'kill',
      },
    });
  }
});
```

## Windows

Sometimes you have window-specific code (a splash screen window, for example), so you need to simulate different windows.
You can use the [`mockWindows()`] method to create fake window labels. The first string identifies the "current" window (i.e., the window your JavaScript believes itself in), and all other strings are treated as additional windows.

:::note

[`mockWindows()`] only fakes the existence of windows but no window properties. To simulate window properties, you need to intercept the correct calls using [`mockIPC()`]

:::

```javascript
import { beforeAll, expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { randomFillSync } from 'crypto';

import { mockWindows } from '@tauri-apps/api/mocks';

// jsdom doesn't come with a WebCrypto implementation
beforeAll(() => {
  Object.defineProperty(window, 'crypto', {
    value: {
      // @ts-ignore
      getRandomValues: (buffer) => {
        return randomFillSync(buffer);
      },
    },
  });
});

test('invoke', async () => {
  mockWindows('main', 'second', 'third');

  const { getCurrent, getAll } = await import('@tauri-apps/api/webviewWindow');

  expect(getCurrent()).toHaveProperty('label', 'main');
  expect(getAll().map((w) => w.label)).toEqual(['main', 'second', 'third']);
});
```

# WebDriver

[WebDriver] is a standardized interface to interact with web documents primarily intended for automated testing.
Tauri supports the [WebDriver] interface by leveraging the native platform's [WebDriver] server underneath a
cross-platform wrapper [`tauri-driver`]. On desktop, only Windows and Linux are supported due to macOS not having
a WKWebView driver tool available. iOS and Android work through Appium 2, but the process is not currently streamlined.

## System Dependencies

Install the latest [`tauri-driver`] or update an existing installation by running:

```shell
cargo install tauri-driver --locked
```

Because we currently utilize the platform's native [WebDriver] server, there are some requirements for running
[`tauri-driver`] on supported platforms.

### Linux

We use `WebKitWebDriver` on Linux platforms. Check if this binary exists already (command `which WebKitWebDriver`) as
some distributions bundle it with the regular WebKit package. Other platforms may have a separate package for them, such
as `webkit2gtk-driver` on Debian-based distributions.

### Windows

Make sure to grab the version of [Microsoft Edge Driver] that matches your Windows Edge version that the application is
being built and tested on. This should almost always be the latest stable version on up-to-date Windows installs. If the
two versions do not match, you may experience your WebDriver testing suite hanging while trying to connect.

The download contains a binary called `msedgedriver.exe`. [`tauri-driver`] looks for that binary in the `$PATH` so make
sure it's either available on the path or use the `--native-driver` option on [`tauri-driver`]. You may want to download this automatically as part of the CI setup process to ensure the Edge, and Edge Driver versions
stay in sync on Windows CI machines. A guide on how to do this may be added at a later date.

## Example Applications

Below are step-by-step guides to show how to create a minimal example application that
is tested with WebDriver.

If you prefer to see the result of the guide and look over a finished minimal codebase that utilizes it, you

# Continuous Integration

Utilizing Linux and some programs to create a fake display, it is possible to run [WebDriver] tests with
[`tauri-driver`] on your CI. The following example uses the [WebdriverIO] example we [previously built together] and
GitHub Actions.

This means the following assumptions:

1. The Tauri application is in the repository root and the binary builds when running `cargo build --release`.
2. The [WebDriverIO] test runner is in the `webdriver/webdriverio` directory and runs when `yarn test` is used in that
   directory.

The following is a commented GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/webdriver.yml`

```yaml
# run this action when the repository is pushed to
on: [push]

# the name of our workflow
name: WebDriver

jobs:
  # a single job named test
  test:
    # the display name of the test job
    name: WebDriverIO Test Runner

    # we want to run on the latest linux environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

    # the steps our job runs **in order**

# Selenium

{/* TODO: REVISE COPY TO V2 */}

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

:::note

Make sure to go through the [prerequisites instructions] to be able to follow this guide.

:::

This WebDriver testing example will use [Selenium] and a popular Node.js testing suite. You are expected to already have
Node.js installed, along with `npm` or `yarn` although the [finished example project] uses `yarn`.

## Create a Directory for the Tests

Let's create a space to write these tests in our project. We will be using a nested directory for
this example project as we will later also go over other frameworks, but typically you will only need to use one. Create
the directory we will use with `mkdir -p webdriver/selenium`. The rest of this guide will assume you are inside the
`webdriver/selenium` directory.

## Initializing a Selenium Project

We will be using a pre-existing `package.json` to bootstrap this test suite because we have already chosen specific
dependencies to use and want to showcase a simple working solution. The bottom of this section has a collapsed
guide on how to set it up from scratch.

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "selenium",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "chai": "^4.3.4",
    "mocha": "^9.0.3",
    "selenium-webdriver": "^4.0.0-beta.4"
  }
}
```

We have a script that runs [Mocha] as a test framework exposed as the `test` command. We also have various dependencies
that we will be using to run the tests. [Mocha] as the testing framework, [Chai] as the assertion library, and
[`selenium-webdriver`] which is the Node.js [Selenium] package.

<details>
  <summary>Click me if you want to see how to set a project up from scratch</summary>

If you want to install the dependencies from scratch, just run the following command.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm install mocha chai selenium-webdriver"
  yarn="yarn add mocha chai selenium-webdriver"
/>

I suggest also adding a `"test": "mocha"` item in the `package.json` `"scripts"` key so that running Mocha can be
called
simply with

<CommandTabs npm="npm test" yarn="yarn test" />

</details>

## Testing

Unlike the [WebdriverIO Test Suite](/develop/tests/webdriver/example/webdriverio/#config), Selenium does not come out of the box with a Test Suite and
leaves it up to the developer to build those out. We chose [Mocha], which is pretty neutral and not related to WebDrivers, so our script will need to do a bit of work to set up everything for us in the correct order. [Mocha] expects a
testing file at `test/test.js` by default, so let's create that file now.

`test/test.js`:

```javascript
const os = require('os');
const path = require('path');
const { expect } = require('chai');
const { spawn, spawnSync } = require('child_process');
const { Builder, By, Capabilities } = require('selenium-webdriver');

// create the path to the expected application binary
const application = path.resolve(
  __dirname,
  '..',
  '..',
  '..',
  'target',
  'release',
  'hello-tauri-webdriver'
);

// keep track of the webdriver instance we create
let driver;

// keep track of the tauri-driver process we start
let tauriDriver;

before(async function () {
  // set timeout to 2 minutes to allow the program to build if it needs to
  this.timeout(120000);

  // ensure the program has been built
  spawnSync('cargo', ['build', '--release']);

  // start tauri-driver
  tauriDriver = spawn(
    path.resolve(os.homedir(), '.cargo', 'bin', 'tauri-driver'),
    [],
    { stdio: [null, process.stdout, process.stderr] }
  );

  const capabilities = new Capabilities();
  capabilities.set('tauri:options', { application });
  capabilities.setBrowserName('wry');

  // start the webdriver client
  driver = await new Builder()
    .withCapabilities(capabilities)
    .usingServer('http://127.0.0.1:4444/')
    .build();
});

after(async function () {
  // stop the webdriver session
  await driver.quit();

  // kill the tauri-driver process
  tauriDriver.kill();
});

describe('Hello Tauri', () => {
  it('should be cordial', async () => {
    const text = await driver.findElement(By.css('body > h1')).getText();
    expect(text).to.match(/^[hH]ello/);
  });

  it('should be excited', async () => {
    const text = await driver.findElement(By.css('body > h1')).getText();
    expect(text).to.match(/!$/);
  });

  it('should be easy on the eyes', async () => {
    // selenium returns color css values as rgb(r, g, b)
    const text = await driver
      .findElement(By.css('body'))
      .getCssValue('background-color');

    const rgb = text.match(/^rgb\((?<r>\d+), (?<g>\d+), (?<b>\d+)\)$/).groups;
    expect(rgb).to.have.all.keys('r', 'g', 'b');

    const luma = 0.2126 * rgb.r + 0.7152 * rgb.g + 0.0722 * rgb.b;
    expect(luma).to.be.lessThan(100);
  });
});
```

If you are familiar with JS testing frameworks, `describe`, `it`, and `expect` should look familiar. We also have
semi-complex `before()` and `after()` callbacks to set up and teardown mocha. Lines that are not the tests themselves
have comments explaining the setup and teardown code. If you were familiar with the Spec file from the
[WebdriverIO example](/develop/tests/webdriver/example/webdriverio/#spec), you notice a lot more code that isn't tests, as we have to set up a few
more WebDriver related items.

## Running the Test Suite

Now that we are all set up with our dependencies and our test script, let's run it!

<CommandTabs npm="npm test" yarn="yarn test" />

We should see output the following output:

```text
➜  selenium git:(main) ✗ yarn test
yarn run v1.22.11
$ Mocha


  Hello Tauri
    ✔ should be cordial (120ms)
    ✔ should be excited
    ✔ should be easy on the eyes


  3 passing (588ms)

Done in 0.93s.
```

We can see that our `Hello Tauri` test suite we created with `describe` had all 3 items we created with `it` pass their
tests!

With [Selenium] and some hooking up to a test suite, we just enabled e2e testing without modifying our Tauri
application at all!

# WebdriverIO

{/* TODO: REVISE COPY TO V2 */}

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

:::note

Make sure to go through the [prerequisites instructions] to be able to follow this guide.

:::

This WebDriver testing example will use [WebdriverIO], and its testing suite. It is expected to have Node.js already
installed, along with `npm` or `yarn` although the [finished example project] uses `yarn`.

## Create a Directory for the Tests

Let's create a space to write these tests in our project. We will be using a nested directory for
this example project as we will later also go over other frameworks, but typically you only need to use one. Create
the directory we will use with `mkdir -p webdriver/webdriverio`. The rest of this guide assumes you are inside the
`webdriver/webdriverio` directory.

## Initializing a WebdriverIO Project

We will be using a pre-existing `package.json` to bootstrap this test suite because we have already chosen specific
[WebdriverIO] config options and want to showcase a simple working solution. The bottom of this section has a collapsed
guide on setting it up from scratch.

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "webdriverio",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "test": "wdio run wdio.conf.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@wdio/cli": "^7.9.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wdio/local-runner": "^7.9.1",
    "@wdio/mocha-framework": "^7.9.1",
    "@wdio/spec-reporter": "^7.9.0"
  }
}
```

We have a script that runs a [WebdriverIO] config as a test suite exposed as the `test` command. We also have various
dependencies added by the `@wdio/cli` command when we first set it up. In short, these dependencies are for
the most simple setup using a local WebDriver runner, [Mocha] as the test framework, and a simple Spec Reporter.

<details>
  <summary>Click me if you want to see how to set a project up from scratch</summary>

The CLI is interactive, and you may choose the tools to work with yourself. Note that you will likely diverge from
the rest of the guide, and you need to set up the differences yourself.

Let's add the [WebdriverIO] CLI to this npm project.

<CommandTabs npm="npm install @wdio/cli" yarn="yarn add @wdio/cli" />

To then run the interactive config command to set up a [WebdriverIO] test suite, you can then run:

<CommandTabs npm="npx wdio config" yarn="yarn wdio config" />

</details>

## Config

You may have noticed that the `test` script in our `package.json` mentions a file `wdio.conf.js`. That's the [WebdriverIO]
config file which controls most aspects of our testing suite.

`wdio.conf.js`:

```javascript
const os = require('os');
const path = require('path');
const { spawn, spawnSync } = require('child_process');

// keep track of the `tauri-driver` child process
let tauriDriver;

exports.config = {
  specs: ['./develop/tests/specs/**/*.js'],
  maxInstances: 1,
  capabilities: [
    {
      maxInstances: 1,
      'tauri:options': {
        application: '../../target/release/hello-tauri-webdriver',
      },
    },
  ],
  reporters: ['spec'],
  framework: 'mocha',
  mochaOpts: {
    ui: 'bdd',
    timeout: 60000,
  },

  // ensure the rust project is built since we expect this binary to exist for the webdriver sessions
  onPrepare: () => spawnSync('cargo', ['build', '--release']),

  // ensure we are running `tauri-driver` before the session starts so that we can proxy the webdriver requests
  beforeSession: () =>
    (tauriDriver = spawn(
      path.resolve(os.homedir(), '.cargo', 'bin', 'tauri-driver'),
      [],
      { stdio: [null, process.stdout, process.stderr] }
    )),

  // clean up the `tauri-driver` process we spawned at the start of the session
  afterSession: () => tauriDriver.kill(),
};
```

If you are interested in the properties on the `exports.config` object, I [suggest reading the documentation][webdriver documentation].
For non-WDIO specific items, there are comments explaining why we are running commands in `onPrepare`, `beforeSession`,
and `afterSession`. We also have our specs set to `"./develop/tests/specs/**/*.js"`, so let's create a spec now.

## Spec

A spec contains the code that is testing your actual application. The test runner will load these specs and automatically
run them as it sees fit. Let's create our spec now in the directory we specified.

`test/specs/example.e2e.js`:

```javascript
// calculates the luma from a hex color `#abcdef`
function luma(hex) {
  if (hex.startsWith('#')) {
    hex = hex.substring(1);
  }

  const rgb = parseInt(hex, 16);
  const r = (rgb >> 16) & 0xff;
  const g = (rgb >> 8) & 0xff;
  const b = (rgb >> 0) & 0xff;
  return 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b;
}

describe('Hello Tauri', () => {
  it('should be cordial', async () => {
    const header = await $('body > h1');
    const text = await header.getText();
    expect(text).toMatch(/^[hH]ello/);
  });

  it('should be excited', async () => {
    const header = await $('body > h1');
    const text = await header.getText();
    expect(text).toMatch(/!$/);
  });

  it('should be easy on the eyes', async () => {
    const body = await $('body');
    const backgroundColor = await body.getCSSProperty('background-color');
    expect(luma(backgroundColor.parsed.hex)).toBeLessThan(100);
  });
});
```

The `luma` function on top is just a helper function for one of our tests and is not related to the actual testing of
the application. If you are familiar with other testing frameworks, you may notice similar functions being exposed that
are used, such as `describe`, `it`, and `expect`. The other APIs, such as items like `$` and its exposed methods, are
covered by the [WebdriverIO API docs].

## Running the Test Suite

Now that we are all set up with config and a spec let's run it!

<CommandTabs npm="npm test" yarn="yarn test" />

We should see output the following output:

```text
➜  webdriverio git:(main) ✗ yarn test
yarn run v1.22.11
$ wdio run wdio.conf.js

Spec Files:	 1 passed, 1 total (100% completed) in 00:00:01

Done in 1.98s.
```

We see the Spec Reporter tell us that all 3 tests from the `test/specs/example.e2e.js` file, along with the final report
`Spec Files: 1 passed, 1 total (100% completed) in 00:00:01`.

Using the [WebdriverIO] test suite, we just easily enabled e2e testing for our Tauri application from just a few lines
of configuration and a single command to run it! Even better, we didn't have to modify the application at all.

# Updating Dependencies

{/* TODO: Add plugin update example */}

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

## Update npm Packages

If you are using the `tauri` package:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest @tauri-apps/api@latest"
  yarn="yarn up @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api"
  pnpm="pnpm update @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api --latest"
/>

You can also detect what the latest version of Tauri is on the command line, using:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm outdated @tauri-apps/cli"
  yarn="yarn outdated @tauri-apps/cli"
  pnpm="pnpm outdated @tauri-apps/cli"
/>

## Update Cargo Packages

You can check for outdated packages with [`cargo outdated`] or on the crates.io pages: [tauri] / [tauri-build].

Go to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and change `tauri` and `tauri-build` to

```toml
[build-dependencies]
tauri-build = "%version%"

[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "%version%" }
```

where `%version%` is the corresponding version number from above.

Then do the following:

```shell
cd src-tauri
cargo update
```

Alternatively, you can run the `cargo upgrade` command provided by [cargo-edit] which does all of this automatically.

## Sync npm Packages and Cargo Crates versions

Since the JavaScript APIs rely on Rust code in the backend, adding a new feature requires upgrading both sides to ensure compatibility. Please make sure you have the same minor version of the npm package `@tauri-apps/api` and cargo crate `tauri` synced

And for the plugins, we might introduce this type of changes in patch releases, so we bump the npm package and cargo crate versions together, and you need to keep the exact versions synced, for example, you need the same version (e.g. `2.2.1`) of the npm package `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs` and cargo crate `tauri-plugin-fs`

import { CardGrid, LinkCard, LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

Tauri provides the tooling you need to distribute your application either to the platform app stores or as platform-specific installers.

## Building

Tauri builds your application directly from its CLI via the `build`, `android build` and `ios build` commands.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build"
  yarn="yarn tauri build"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build"
  deno="deno task tauri build"
  bun="bun tauri build"
  cargo="cargo tauri build"
/>

See the [distributing](#distributing) section to learn more about the configuration options available for each bundle
and how to distribute them to your users.

:::note
Most platforms requires code signing. See the [signing](#signing) section for more information.
:::

### Bundling

By default the `build` command automatically bundles your application for the configured formats.

If you need further customization on how the platform bundles are generated, you can split the build and bundle steps:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle
# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store
npm run tauri bundle -- --bundles app,dmg
# bundle for App Store distribution
npm run tauri bundle -- --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --no-bundle
# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store
yarn tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg
# bundle for App Store distribution
yarn tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --no-bundle
# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store
pnpm tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg
# bundle for App Store distribution
pnpm tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  deno="deno task tauri build --no-bundle
# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store
deno task tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg
# bundle for App Store distribution
deno task tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  bun="bun tauri build --no-bundle
# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store
bun tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg
# bundle for App Store distribution
bun tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --no-bundle
# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store
cargo tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg
# bundle for App Store distribution
cargo tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
/>

## Versioning

Your application version can be defined in the [`tauri.conf.json > version`] configuration option,
which is the recommended way for managing the app version. If that config value is not set,
Tauri uses the `package > version` value from your `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` file instead.

:::note
Some platforms have some limitations and special cases for the version string.
See the individual distribution documentation pages for more information.
:::

## Signing

Code signing enhances the security of your application by applying a digital signature to your
application's executables and bundles, validating your identity of the provider of your application.

Signing is required on most platforms. See the documentation for each platform for more information.

# App Store

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

The [Apple App Store] is the app marketplace maintained by Apple.
You can distribute your Tauri app targeting macOS and iOS via this App Store.

This guide only covers details for distributing apps directly to the App Store.
See the general [App Bundle][App Bundle distribution guide] for more information on macOS distribution options and configurations.

## Requirements

Distributing iOS and macOS apps requires enrolling to the [Apple Developer] program.

Additionally, you must setup code signing for [macOS][macOS code signing] and [iOS][iOS code signing].

## Changing App Icon

After running `tauri ios init` to setup the Xcode project, you can use the `tauri icon` command to update the app icons.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png -- --ios-color #fff"
  yarn="yarn tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
  deno="deno task tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
  bun="bun tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
  cargo="cargo tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
/>

The `--ios-color` argument defines the background color for the iOS icons.

## Setting up

After enrolling to the Apple Developer program, the first step to distribute your Tauri app in the App Store
is to register your app in the [App Store Connect][app-store-connect-apps].

:::note
The value provided in the _Bundle ID_ field **must** match the identifier defined in [`tauri.conf.json > identifier`].
:::

## Build and upload

The Tauri CLI can package your app for macOS and iOS. Running on a macOS machine is a requirement.

Tauri derives the [`CFBundleVersion`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleversion) from the value defined in [`tauri.conf.json > version`].
You can set a custom bundle version in the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > iOS > bundleVersion`] or [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > bundleVersion`] configuration
if you need a different bundle version scheme e.g. sequential codes:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "iOS": {
      "bundleVersion": "100"
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution
Code signing is required. See the documentation for [macOS][macOS code signing] and [iOS][iOS code signing].
:::

Note that Tauri leverages Xcode for the iOS app so you can use Xcode to archive and distribute for iOS instead of the Tauri CLI.
To open the iOS project in Xcode for building you must run the following command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri ios build -- --open"
  yarn="yarn tauri ios build --open"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri ios build --open"
  deno="deno task tauri ios build --open"
  bun="bun tauri ios build --open"
  cargo="cargo tauri ios build --open"
/>

### macOS

To upload your app to the App Store, first you must ensure all required configuration options are set
so you can package the App Bundle, create a signed `.pkg` file and upload it.

The following sections will guide you through the process.

#### Setup

Your app must include some configurations to be accepted by the App Store verification system.

:::tip
The following sections guides you through configuring your app for App Store submissions.

To apply the following config changes only when building for App Store, you can create a separate Tauri configuration file:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "entitlements": "./Entitlements.plist",
      "files": {
        "embedded.provisionprofile": "path/to/profile-name.provisionprofile"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then merge that config file with the main one when bundling your Tauri app for App Store:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle
npm run tauri bundle -- --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --no-bundle
yarn tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --no-bundle
pnpm tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  deno="deno task tauri build --no-bundle
deno task tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  bun="bun tauri build --no-bundle
bun tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --no-bundle
cargo tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
/>

This is particularly useful when setting up your CI/CD to upload your app to the App Store while not requiring the provision profile locally or
when compiling the app for distribution outside the App Store.

:::

- Category

Your app must define its [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > category`] to be displayed in the App Store:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={3}
{
  "bundle": {
    "category": "Utility"
  }
}
```

- Provisioning profile

You must also create a provisioning profile for your app to be accepted by Apple.

In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) page,
create a new App ID and make sure its "Bundle ID" value matches the identifier set in [`tauri.conf.json > identifier`].

Navigate to the [Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list) page to create a new provisioning profile.
For App Store macOS distribution, it must be a "Mac App Store Connect" profile.
Select the appropriate App ID and link the certificate you are using for code signing.

After creating the provisioning profile, download it and save it to a known location and configure Tauri to include it in your app bundle:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4-6}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "files": {
        "embedded.provisionprofile": "path/to/profile-name.provisionprofile"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Info.plist

Your app must comply with encryption export regulations.
See the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying-with-encryption-export-regulations?language=objc)
for more information.

Create a Info.plist file in the src-tauri folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
	<false/> # or `true` if your app uses encryption
</dict>
</plist>
```

- Entitlements

Your app must include the App Sandbox capability to be distributed in the App Store.
Additionally, you must also set your App ID and Team ID in the code signing entitlements.

Create a `Entitlements.plist` file in the `src-tauri` folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.application-identifier</key>
    <string>$TEAM_ID.$IDENTIFIER</string>
    <key>com.apple.developer.team-identifier</key>
    <string>$TEAM_ID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Note that you must replace `$IDENTIFIER` with the [`tauri.conf.json > identifier`] value
and `$TEAM_ID` with your Apple Developer team ID, which can be found in the `App ID Prefix` section in the
[Identifier](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) you created for the provisioning profile.

And reference that file in the macOS bundle configuration [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > entitlements`]:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "entitlements": "./Entitlements.plist"
    }
  }
}
```

You now must build your application with code signing enabled for the entitlements to apply.

Make sure your app works when running in an App Sandbox context.

#### Build

You must upload your macOS application as a `.pkg` file to the App Store.
Run the following command to package your app as a macOS App Bundle (`.app` extension):

```
tauri build --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin
```

:::note
The above command creates an Universal App Binary application, supporting both Apple Silicon and Intel processors.

If you prefer to only support Apple Silicon instead, you must change [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > minimumSystemVersion`] to `12.0`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "minimumSystemVersion": "12.0"
    }
  }
}
```

And change the CLI command and output path based on the Mac system you are running:

- if your build system uses an Apple Silicon chip, remove the `--target universal-apple-darwin` arguments and use `target/release`
  instead of `target/universal-apple-darwin/release` in the paths referenced below.
- if your build system uses an Intel chip:
  - install the Rust Apple Silicon target:
    ```
    rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
    ```
  - change the `universal-apple-darwin` argument to `aarch64-apple-darwin`
    and use `target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release` instead of `target/universal-apple-darwin/release` in the paths referenced below.

:::

See the [App Bundle distribution guide] for more information on configuration options.

To generate a signed `.pkg` from your app bundle, run the following command:

```
xcrun productbuild --sign "<certificate signing identity>" --component "target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bundle/macos/$APPNAME.app" /Applications "$APPNAME.pkg"
```

Note that you must replace _$APPNAME_ with your app name.

:::note
You must sign the PKG with a _Mac Installer Distribution_ signing certificate.
:::

#### Upload

Now you can use the [`altool`] CLI to upload your app PKG to the App Store:

```
xcrun altool --upload-app --type macos --file "$APPNAME.pkg" --apiKey $APPLE_API_KEY_ID --apiIssuer $APPLE_API_ISSUER
```

Note that `altool` requires an App Store Connect API key to upload your app.
See the [authentication section] for more information.

Your app will then be validated by Apple and available in TestFlight if approved.

### iOS

To build your iOS app, run the `tauri ios build` command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri ios build -- --export-method app-store-connect"
  yarn="yarn tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
  deno="deno task tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
  bun="bun tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
  cargo="cargo tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
/>

The generated IPA file can be found in `src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/$APPNAME.ipa`.

Note that you must replace _$APPNAME_ with your app name.

Now you can use the `altool` CLI to upload your iOS app to the App Store:

```
xcrun altool --upload-app --type ios --file "src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/$APPNAME.ipa" --apiKey $APPLE_API_KEY_ID --apiIssuer $APPLE_API_ISSUER
```

Note that `altool` requires an App Store Connect API key to upload your app.
See the [authentication section] for more information.

Your app will then be validated by Apple and available in TestFlight if approved.

### Authentication

The iOS and macOS apps are uploaded using `altool`, which uses an App Store Connect API key to authenticate.

To create a new API key, open the [App Store Connect's Users and Access page], select the Integrations > Individual Keys tab, click on the Add button and select a name and the Developer access.
The `APPLE_API_ISSUER` (Issuer ID) is presented above the keys table, and the `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` is the value on the Key ID column on that table.
You also need to download the private key, which can only be done once and is only visible after a page reload (the button is shown on the table row for the newly created key).
The private key file path must be saved as `AuthKey\_<APPLE_API_KEY_ID>.p8` in one of these directories:`<current-working-directory>/private_keys`, `~/private_keys`, `~/.private_keys`or`~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys`.

# AppImage

`AppImage` is a distribution format that does not rely on the system installed packages and instead bundles all dependencies and files needed by the application. For this reason, the output file is larger but easier to distribute since it is supported on many Linux distributions and can be executed without installation. The user just needs to make the file executable (`chmod a+x MyProject.AppImage`) and can then run it (`./MyProject.AppImage`).

AppImages are convenient, simplifying the distribution process if you cannot make a package targeting the distribution's package manager. Still, you should carefully use it as the file size grows from the 2-6 MB range to 70+ MB.

## Multimedia support via GStreamer

If your app plays audio/video you need to enable `tauri.conf.json > bundle > linux > appimage > bundleMediaFramework`. This will increase the size of the AppImage bundle to include additional gstreamer files needed for media playback. This flag is currently only fully supported on Ubuntu build systems. Make sure that your build system has all the plugins your app may need at runtime.

:::caution

GStreamer plugins in the `ugly` package are licensed in a way that may make it hard to distribute them as part of your app.

:::

{/* TODO: Add some reference links for gst setup/plugins */}

## Custom Files

To include custom files in the AppImage that you do not want to include via Tauri's [`resources` feature](/develop/resources/), you can provide a list of files or folders in `tauri.conf.json > bundle > linux > appimage > files`. The configuration object maps the path in the AppImage to the path to the file on your filesystem, relative to the `tauri.conf.json` file. Here's an example configuration:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "linux": {
      "appimage": {
        "files": {
          "/usr/share/README.md": "../README.md", // copies the ../README.md file to <appimage>/usr/share/README.md
          "/usr/assets": "../assets/" // copies the entire ../assets directory to <appimage>/usr/assets
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

Note that the destination paths must currently begin with `/usr/`.

:::

## AppImages for ARM-based devices

`linuxdeploy`, the AppImage tooling Tauri uses, currently [does not support cross-compiling] ARM AppImages. This means ARM AppImages can only be built on ARM devices or emulators.

Check out our [GitHub Action guide](/distribute/pipelines/github/#arm-runner-compilation) for an example workflow that leverages QEMU to build the app. Note that this is extremely slow and only recommended in public repositories where Build Minutes are free. In private repositories GitHub's ARM runners should be more cost-efficient and much easier to set up.

[does not support cross-compiling]: https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy/issues/258

# AUR

# Publishing To The Arch User Repository

## Setup

First go to `https://aur.archlinux.org` and make an account. Be sure to add the proper ssh keys. Next, clone an empty git repository using this command.

```sh
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/your-repo-name
```

After completing the steps above, create a file with the name `PKGBUILD`. Once the file is created you can move onto the next step.

### Writing a PKGBUILD file

```ini title="PKGBUILD"
pkgname=<pkgname>
pkgver=1.0.0
pkgrel=1
pkgdesc="Description of your app"
arch=('x86_64' 'aarch64')
url="https://github.com/<user>/<project>"
license=('MIT')
depends=('cairo' 'desktop-file-utils' 'gdk-pixbuf2' 'glib2' 'gtk3' 'hicolor-icon-theme' 'libsoup' 'pango' 'webkit2gtk-4.1')
options=('!strip' '!emptydirs')
install=${pkgname}.install
source_x86_64=("${url}/releases/download/v${pkgver}/appname_${pkgver}_amd64.deb")
source_aarch64=("${url}/releases/download/v${pkgver}/appname_"${pkgver}_arm64.deb")
```

- At the top of the file, define your package name and assign it the variable `pkgname`.
- Set your `pkgver` variable. Typically it is best to use this variable in the source variable to increase maintainability.
- The `pkgdesc` variable on your aur repo's page and tells vistors what your app does.
- The `arch` variable controls what architectures can install your package.
- The `url` variable, while not required, helps to make your package appear more professional.
- The `install` variable specifies the name of .install script which will be run when the package is installed, removed or upgraded.
- The `depends` variable includes a list of items that are required to make your app run. For any Tauri app you must include all of the dependencies shown above.
- The `source` variable is required and defines the location where your upstream package is. You can make a `source` architecture specific by adding the architecture to the end of the variable name.

### Generating `.SRCINFO`

In order to push your repo to the aur you must generate an `.SRCINFO` file. This can be done with this command.

```sh
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
```

### Testing

Testing the app is extremely simple. All you have to do is run `makepkg` within the same directory as the `PKGBUILD` file and see if it works

### Publishing

Finally, after the testing phase is over, you can publish the application to AUR (Arch User Repository) with these commands.

```sh
git add .

git commit -m "Initial Commit"

git push
```

If all goes well, your repository should now appear on the AUR website.

# Debian

{/* Is this about building .deb files, creating PPAs, or adding something to the debian/ubuntu repos? */}

## Debian

The stock Debian package generated by the Tauri bundler has everything you need to ship your application to Debian-based Linux distributions, defining your application's icons, generating a Desktop file, and specifying the dependencies `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` and `libgtk-3-0`, along with `libappindicator3-1` if your app uses the system tray.

### Custom Files

Tauri exposes a few configurations for the Debian package in case you need more control.

If your app depends on additional system dependencies you can specify them in `tauri.conf.json > bundle > linux > deb`.

To include custom files in the Debian package, you can provide a list of files or folders in `tauri.conf.json > bundle > linux > deb > files`. The configuration object maps the path in the Debian package to the path to the file on your filesystem, relative to the `tauri.conf.json` file. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "linux": {
      "deb": {
        "files": {
          "/usr/share/README.md": "../README.md", // copies the README.md file to /usr/share/README.md
          "/usr/share/assets": "../assets/" // copies the entire assets directory to /usr/share/assets
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# DMG

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import StandardDmgLight from '@assets/distribute/dmg/standard-dmg-light.png';
import StandardDmgDark from '@assets/distribute/dmg/standard-dmg-dark.png';

The DMG (Apple Disk Image) format is a common macOS installer file that wraps your [App Bundle][App Bundle distribution guide] in a user-friendly installation window.

The installer window includes your app icon and the Applications folder icon, where the user is expected to drag the app icon to the Applications folder icon to install it.
It is the most common installation method for macOS applications distributed outside the App Store.

This guide only covers details for distributing apps outside the App Store using the DMG format.
See the [App Bundle distribution guide] for more information on macOS distribution options and configurations.
To distribute your macOS app in the App Store, see the [App Store distribution guide].

To create an Apple Disk Image for your app you can use the Tauri CLI and run the `tauri build` command in a Mac computer:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --bundles dmg"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --bundles dmg"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --bundles dmg"
  deno="deno task tauri build --bundles dmg"
  bun="bun tauri build --bundles dmg"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --bundles dmg"
/>

<Image
  class="dark:sl-hidden"
  src={StandardDmgLight}
  alt="Standard DMG window"
/>
<Image
  class="light:sl-hidden"
  src={StandardDmgDark}
  alt="Standard DMG window"
/>

## Window background

You can set a custom background image to the DMG installation window with the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > dmg > background`] configuration option:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4-6}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "dmg": {
        "background": "./images/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For instance your DMG background image can include an arrow to indicate to the user that it must drag the app icon to the Applications folder.

## Window size and position

The default window size is 660x400. If you need a different size to fit your custom background image, set the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > dmg > windowSize`] configuration:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={5-8}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "dmg": {
        "windowSize": {
          "width": 800,
          "height": 600
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally you can set the initial window position via [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > dmg > windowPosition`]:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={5-8}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "dmg": {
        "windowPosition": {
          "x": 400,
          "y": 400
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Icon position

You can change the app and _Applications folder_ icon position
with the [appPosition] and [applicationFolderPosition] configuration values respectively:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={5-12}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "dmg": {
        "appPosition": {
          "x": 180,
          "y": 220
        },
        "applicationFolderPosition": {
          "x": 480,
          "y": 220
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution
Due to a known issue, icon sizes and positions are not applied when creating DMGs on CI/CD platforms.
See [tauri-apps/tauri#1731] for more information.

# Flathub

import { Tabs, TabItem, Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

For detailed information on how Flatpak works, you can read [Building your first Flatpak](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html)

This guide assumes you want to distribute your Flatpak via [Flathub](https://flathub.org/), the most commonly used platform for Flatpak distribution. If you plan on using other platforms, please consult their documentation instead.

## Prerequisites

To test your app inside the Flatpak runtime you can build the Flatpak locally first before uploading your app to Flathub. This can also be helpful if you want to quickly share development builds.

**1. Install `flatpak` and `flatpak-builder`**

To build Flatpaks locally you need the `flatpak` and `flatpak-builder` tools. For example on Ubuntu you can run this command:

<Tabs syncKey="distro">
  <TabItem label="Debian">

```sh
sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Arch">

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed flatpak flatpak-builder
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fedora">

```sh
sudo dnf install flatpak flatpak-builder
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gentoo">

```sh
sudo emerge --ask \
sys-apps/flatpak \
dev-util/flatpak-builder
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**2. Install the Flatpak Runtime**

```shell
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform//46 org.gnome.Sdk//46
```

**3. [Build the .deb of your tauri-app](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/config/#bundleconfig)**

**4. [Create an AppStream MetaInfo file](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/metainfocreator/#/guiapp)**

**5. Create the flatpak manifest**

```yaml
# flatpak-builder.yaml
id: <identifier>

runtime: org.gnome.Platform
runtime-version: '46'
sdk: org.gnome.Sdk

command: <main_binary_name>
finish-args:
  - --socket=wayland # Permission needed to show the window
  - --socket=fallback-x11 # Permission needed to show the window
  - --device=dri # OpenGL, not necessary for all projects
  - --share=ipc
  - --talk-name=org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher # Optional: needed only if your app uses the tray icon
  - --filesystem=xdg-run/tray-icon:create # Optional: needed only if your app uses the tray icon - see an alternative way below
  # - --env=WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 # Optional: may solve some issues with black webviews on Wayland

modules:
  - name: binary
    buildsystem: simple

    sources:
      # A reference to the previously generated flatpak metainfo file
      - type: file
        path: flatpak.metainfo.xml
      # If you use GitHub releases, you can target an existing remote file
      - type: file
        url: https://github.com/your_username/your_repository/releases/download/v1.0.1/yourapp_1.0.1_amd64.deb
        sha256: 08305b5521e2cf0622e084f2b8f7f31f8a989fc7f407a7050fa3649facd61469 # This is required if you are using a remote source
        only-arches: [x86_64] # This source is only used on x86_64 Computers
      # You can also use a local file for testing
      # - type: file
      #   path: yourapp_1.0.1_amd64.deb
    build-commands:
      - set -e

      # Extract the deb package
      - mkdir deb-extract
      - ar -x *.deb --output deb-extract
      - tar -C deb-extract -xf deb-extract/data.tar.gz

      # Copy binary
      - 'install -Dm755 deb-extract/usr/bin/<executable_name> /app/bin/<executable_name>'

      # If you bundle files with additional resources, you should copy them:
      - mkdir -p /app/lib/<product_name>
      - cp -r deb-extract/usr/lib/<product_name>/. /app/lib/<product_name>
      - find /app/lib/<product_name> -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

      # Copy desktop file + ensure the right icon is set
      - sed -i 's/^Icon=.*/Icon=<identifier>/' deb-extract/usr/share/applications/<product_name>.desktop
      - install -Dm644 deb-extract/usr/share/applications/<product_name>.desktop /app/share/applications/<identifier>.desktop

      # Copy icons
      - install -Dm644 deb-extract/usr/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/<main_binary_name>.png /app/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/<identifier>.png
      - install -Dm644 deb-extract/usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/<main_binary_name>.png /app/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/<identifier>.png
      - install -Dm644 deb-extract/usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256@2/apps/<main_binary_name>.png /app/share/icons/hicolor/256x256@2/apps/<identifier>.png
      - install -Dm644 flatpak.metainfo.xml /app/share/metainfo/<identifier>.metainfo.xml
```

The Gnome 46 runtime includes all dependencies of the standard Tauri app with their correct versions.

:::note[Using tray-icon without changing the Flatpak manifest]
If you prefer not opening access from your app to $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (where tray-icon is saved on linux), you can change the path tauri saves the tray image:

```rust
TrayIconBuilder::new()
  .icon(app.default_window_icon().unwrap().clone())
  .temp_dir_path(app.path().app_cache_dir().unwrap()) // will save to the cache folder ($XDG_CACHE_HOME) where the app already has permission
  .build()
  .unwrap();
```

:::

**5. Install, and Test the app**

```shell

# Install the flatpak
flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --disable-cache --repo flatpak-repo flatpak flatpak-builder.yaml

# Run it
flatpak run <your flatpak id> # or via your desktop environment

# Update it
flatpak -y --user update <your flatpak id>
```

## Adding additional libraries

If your final binary requires more libraries than the default tauri app, you need to add them in your flatpak manifest.
There are two ways to do this. For fast local development, it may work to simply include the already built library file (`.so`) from your local system.
However, this is not recommended for the final build of the flatpak, as your local library file is not built for the flatpak runtime environment.
This can introduce various bugs that can be very hard to find.
Therefore, it is recommended to build the library your program depends on from source inside the flatpak as a build step.

## Submitting to flathub

**_1. Fork The [Flathub Repository](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/fork)_**

**_2. Clone the Fork_**

```shell
git clone --branch=new-pr git@github.com:your_github_username/flathub.git
```

**_3. Enter the repository_**

```shell
cd flathub
```

**_4. Create a new branch_**

```shell
git checkout -b your_app_name
```

**_5. Add your apps manifest to the branch. Commit your changes, and then push them._**

**_6. Open a pull request against the `new-pr` branch on github_**

**_7. Your app will now enter the review process in which you may be asked to make changes to your project._**

When your pull request is approved then you will receive an invitation to edit your apps repository. From here on you can update your app continuously.

You can read more about this [in the flatpak documentation](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/dependencies.html#bundling)

# Google Play

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

Google Play is the Android app distribution service maintained by Google.

This guide covers the requirements for publishing your Android app on Google Play.
:::note
Tauri uses an Android Studio project under the hood, so any official practice for
building and publishing Android apps also apply to your app.
See the [official documentation] for more information.
:::

## Requirements

To distribute Android apps in the Play Store you must create a [Play Console] developer account.

Additionally, you must setup [code signing].

See the [release checklist] for more information.

## Changing App Icon

After running `tauri android init` to setup the Android Studio project, you can use the `tauri icon` command to update the app icons.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  yarn="yarn tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  deno="deno task tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  bun="bun tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  cargo="cargo tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
/>

## Setting up

Once you've created a Play Console developer account, you need to register your app on the Google [Play Console] website. It will guide you through all the required forms and setup tasks.

## Build

You can build an Android App Bundle (AAB) to upload to Google Play by running the following command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri android build -- --aab"
  yarn="yarn tauri android build --aab"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri android build --aab"
  deno="deno task tauri android build --aab"
  bun="bun tauri android build --aab"
  cargo="cargo tauri android build --aab"
/>

Tauri derives the version code from the value defined in [`tauri.conf.json > version`] (`versionCode = major*1000000 + minor*1000 + patch`).
You can set a custom version code in the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > android > versionCode`] configuration
if you need a different version code scheme e.g. sequential codes:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 100
    }
  }
}
```

### Build APKs

The AAB format is the recommended bundle file to upload to Google Play, but it is also possible to generate APKs
that can be used for testing or distribution outside the store.
To compile APKs for your app you can use the `--apk` argument:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri android build -- --apk"
  yarn="yarn tauri android build --apk"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri android build --apk"
  deno="deno task tauri android build --apk"
  bun="bun tauri android build --apk"
  cargo="cargo tauri android build --apk"
/>

### Architecture selection

By default Tauri builds your app for all supported architectures (aarch64, armv7, i686 and x86_64).
To only compile for a subset of targets, you can use the `--target` argument:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri android build -- --aab --target aarch64 --target armv7"
  yarn="yarn tauri android build --aab --target aarch64 --target armv7"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri android build --aab --target aarch64 --target armv7"
  deno="deno task tauri android build --aab --target aarch64 --target armv7"
  bun="bun tauri android build --aab --target aarch64 --target armv7"
  cargo="cargo tauri android build --aab --target aarch64 --target armv7"
/>

### Separate bundles per architecture

By default the generated AAB and APK is universal, containing all supported targets.
To generate individual bundles per target, use the `--split-per-abi` argument.
:::note
This is only useful for testing or distribution outside Google Play, as it reduces the file size but is less convenient to upload. Google Play handles the supported architectures for you.
:::

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri android build -- --apk --split-per-abi"
  yarn="yarn tauri android build --apk --split-per-abi"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri android build --apk --split-per-abi"
  deno="deno task tauri android build --apk --split-per-abi"
  bun="bun tauri android build --apk --split-per-abi"
  cargo="cargo tauri android build --apk --split-per-abi"
/>

### Changing the minimum supported Android version

The minimum supported Android version for Tauri apps is Android 7.0 (codename Nougat, SDK 24).

There are some techniques to use newer Android APIs while still supporting older systems.
See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/platforms#version-codes) for more information.

If your app must execute on a newer Android version, you can configure [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > android > minSdkVersion`]:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "android": {
      "minSdkVersion": 28
    }
  }
}
```

## Upload

After building your app and generating the Android App Bundle file,
which can be found in `gen/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/universalRelease/app-universal-release.aab`,
you can now create a new release and upload it in the Google Play Console.

The first upload must be made manually in the website so it can verify your app signature and bundle identifier.
Tauri currently does not offer a way to automate the process of creating Android releases,
which must leverage the [Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest),
but it is a work in progress.

# macOS Application Bundle

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

An application bundle is the package format that is executed on macOS. It is a simple directory that includes everything your application requires for successful operation,
including your app executable, resources, the Info.plist file and other files such as macOS frameworks.

To package your app as a macOS application bundle you can use the Tauri CLI and run the `tauri build` command in a Mac computer:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --bundles app"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --bundles app"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --bundles app"
  deno="deno task tauri build --bundles app"
  bun="bun tauri build --bundles app"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --bundles app"
/>

## File structure

The macOS app bundle is a directory with the following structure:

```
├── <productName>.app
│   ├── Contents
│   │   ├── Info.plist
│   │   ├── ...additional files from [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > files`]
│   ├── MacOS
│   │   ├── <app-name> (app executable)
│   ├── Resources
│   │   ├── icon.icns (app icon)
│   │   ├── ...resources from [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > resources`]
│   ├── _CodeSignature (codesign information generated by Apple)
│   ├── Frameworks
│   ├── PlugIns
│   ├── SharedSupport
```

See the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/BundleTypes/BundleTypes.html) for more information.

## Native configuration

The app bundle is configured by the `Info.plist` file, which includes key-value pairs with your app identity and configuration values read by macOS.

Tauri automatically configures the most important properties such as your app binary name, version. bundle identifier, minimum system version and more.

To extend the configuration file, create an `Info.plist` file in the `src-tauri` folder and include the key-pairs you desire:

```xml title="src-tauri/Info.plist"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Request camera access for WebRTC</string>
	<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Request microphone access for WebRTC</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

This `Info.plist` file is merged with the values generated by the Tauri CLI. Be careful when overwriting default values such as application version as they might conflict with other configuration values
and introduce unexpected behavior.

See the [official Info.plist documentation] for more information.

### Info.plist localization

The `Info.plist` file by itself only supports a single language, typically English. If you want to support multiple languages, you can create `InfoPlist.strings` files for each additional language. Each file belongs in its own language specific `lproj` directory in the `Resources` directory in the application bundle.

To bundle these files automatically you can leverage Tauri's [resources] feature. To do that, create a file structure in your project following this pattern:

```
├── src-tauri
│   ├── tauri.conf.json
│   ├── infoplist
│   │   ├── de.lproj
│   │   │   ├── InfoPlist.strings
│   │   ├── fr.lproj
│   │   │   ├── InfoPlist.strings
```

While the `infoplist` directory name can be chosen freely, as long as you update it in the resources config below, the `lproj` directories must follow the `<lang-code>.lproj` naming and the string catalogue files must be named `InfoPlist.strings` (capital i and p). For most cases the language code should be a two letter code following [BCP 47].

For the `Info.plist` example shown above, the `de.lproj > InfoPlist.strings` file could look like this:

```ini title="de.lproj/InfoPlist.strings"
NSCameraUsageDescription = "Kamera Zugriff wird benötigt für WebRTC Funktionalität";
NSMicrophoneUsageDescription = "Mikrofon Zugriff wird benötigt für WebRTC Funktionalität";
```

Lastly, make Tauri pick up these files by using the resources feature mentioned above:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "resources": {
      "infoplist/**": "./"
    }
  }
}
```

## Entitlements

An entitlement is a special Apple configuration key-value pair that acts as a right or privilege that grants your app particular capabilities,
such as act as the user's default email client and using the App Sandbox feature.

Entitlements are applied when your application is signed. See the [code signing documentation] for more information.

To define the entitlements required by your application, you must create the entitlements file and configure Tauri to use it.

1. Create a `Entitlements.plist` file in the `src-tauri` folder and configure the key-value pairs you app requires:

```xml title="src-tauri/Entitlements.plist"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

2. Configure Tauri to use the Entitlements.plist file:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "entitlements": "./Entitlements.plist"
    }
  }
}
```

See the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements) for more information.

## Minimum system version

By default your Tauri application supports macOS 10.13 and above. If you are using an API that requires a newer macOS system and want to enforce that requirement in your app bundle,
you can configure the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > minimumSystemVersion`] value:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "minimumSystemVersion": "12.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Including macOS frameworks

If your application requires additional macOS frameworks to run, you can list them in the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > frameworks`] configuration.
The frameworks list can include either system or custom frameworks and dylib files.

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4-8}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "frameworks": [
        "CoreAudio",
        "./libs/libmsodbcsql.18.dylib",
        "./frameworks/MyApp.framework"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

- To reference a system framework you can just use its name (without the .framework extension) instead of absolute path
- System frameworks must exist in either the `$HOME/Library/Frameworks`, `/Library/Frameworks/`, or `/Network/Library/Frameworks/`
- To reference local frameworks and dylib files you must use the complete path to the framework, relative to the `src-tauri` directory

:::

## Adding custom files

You can use the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > files`] configuration to add custom files to your application bundle,
which maps the destination path to its source relative to the `tauri.conf.json` file.
The files are added to the `<product-name>.app/Contents` folder.

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4-7}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "files": {
        "embedded.provisionprofile": "./profile-name.provisionprofile",
        "SharedSupport/docs.md": "./docs/index.md"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `profile-name.provisionprofile` file is copied to `<product-name>.app/Contents/embedded.provisionprofile`
and the `docs/index.md` file is copied to `<product-name>.app/Contents/SharedSupport/docs.md`.

# Microsoft Store

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

Microsoft Store is the Windows app store operated by Microsoft.

This guide only covers details for distributing Windows Apps directly to the Microsoft Store.
See the [Windows Installer guide] for more information on Windows installer distribution options and configurations.

## Requirements

To publish apps on the Microsoft Store you must have a Microsoft account
and [enroll] as a developer either as an individual or as a company.

## Changing App Icon

The Tauri CLI can generate all icons your app needs, including Microsoft Store icons.
Use the `tauri icon` command to generate app icons from a single PNG or SVG source:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  yarn="yarn tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  deno="deno task tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  bun="bun tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
  cargo="cargo tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png"
/>

## Setting up

After you have enrolled as a developer with your Microsoft account you need to register your app in the [Apps and Games] page.
Click `New Product`, select `EXE or MSI app` and reserve a unique name for your app.

## Build and upload

Currently Tauri only generates [EXE and MSI][Windows Installer guide] installers, so you must create a Microsoft Store application
that only links to the unpacked application.
The installer linked in the Microsoft Installer must be offline, [handle auto-updates] and be [code signed].

See the [official publish documentation] for more information.

### Offline Installer

The Windows installer distributed through the Microsoft Store must use the [Offline Installer] Webview2 installation option.

To only apply this installer configuration when bundling for Microsoft Store, you can define a separate Tauri configuration file:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "offlineInstaller"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then merge that config file with the main one when bundling your Tauri app for Microsoft Store:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle
npm run tauri bundle -- --config src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --no-bundle
yarn tauri bundle --config src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --no-bundle
pnpm tauri bundle --config src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json"
  deno="deno task tauri build --no-bundle
deno task tauri bundle --config src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json"
  bun="bun tauri build --no-bundle
bun tauri bundle --config src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --no-bundle
cargo tauri bundle --config src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json"
/>

This is particularly useful when setting up your CI/CD to upload your app to the Microsoft Store while having a separate configuration
for the Windows installer you distribute outside the app store.

### Publisher

Your application [publisher] name cannot match the application product name.

If the publisher configuration value is not set, Tauri derives it from the second part of your bundle identifier.
Since the publisher name cannot match the product name, the following configuration is invalid:

```json title=tauri.conf.json "example" "Example"
{
  "productName": "Example",
  "identifier": "com.example.app"
}
```

In this case you can define the [publisher] value separately to fix this conflict:

```json title=tauri.conf.json ins={4-6}
{
  "productName": "Example",
  "identifier": "com.example.app",
  "bundle": {
    "publisher": "Example Inc."
  }
}
```

### Upload

After building the Windows installer for Microsoft Store, you can upload it to the distribution service of your choice
and link it in your application page in the Microsoft Store website.

# CrabNebula Cloud

## Distributing with CrabNebula Cloud

[CrabNebula](https://crabnebula.dev) is an official Tauri partner providing services and tooling for Tauri applications.
The [CrabNebula Cloud](https://crabnebula.dev/cloud/) is a platform for application distribution that seamlessly integrates with the Tauri updater.

The Cloud offers a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that is capable of shipping your application installers and updates globally while being cost effective and exposing download metrics.

With the CrabNebula Cloud service it is simple to implement multiple release channels, download buttons for your application website and more.

Setting up your Tauri app to use the Cloud is easy: all you need to do is to sign in to the [Cloud website] using your GitHub account, create your organization and application and install its CLI to create a release and upload the Tauri bundles. Additionally, a [GitHub Action] is provided to simplify the process of using the CLI on GitHub workflows.

For more information, see the [CrabNebula Cloud documentation].

# GitHub

This guide will show you how to use [tauri-action](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action) in [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to easily build and upload your app, and how to make Tauri's updater query the newly created GitHub release for updates.

Lastly, it will also show how to set up a more complicated build pipeline for Linux Arm AppImages.

:::note[Code Signing]

To set up code signing for Windows and macOS in your workflow, follow the specific guide for each platform:

- [Windows Code Signing](/distribute/sign/windows/)
- [macOS Code Signing](/distribute/sign/macos/)

:::

## Getting Started

To set up `tauri-action` you must first set up a GitHub repository. You can also use this action on a repository that does not have Tauri configured yet since it can automatically initialize Tauri for you, please see the [action's readme](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/#project-initialization) for necessary configuration options.

Go to the Actions tab on your GitHub project page and select "New workflow", then choose "Set up a workflow yourself". Replace the file with the workflow from [below](#example-workflow) or from one of the [action's examples](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/tree/dev/examples).

## Configuration

Please see the `tauri-action` [readme](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/#inputs) for all available configuration options.

When your app is not on the root of the repository, use the `projectPath` input.

You may freely modify the workflow name, change its triggers, and add more steps such as `npm run lint` or `npm run test`. The important part is that you keep the below line at the end of the workflow since this runs the build script and releases your app.

### How to Trigger

The release workflow shown below and in the `tauri-action` examples is triggered by pushed to the `release` branch. The action automatically creates a git tag and a title for the GitHub release using the application version.

As another example, you can also change the trigger to run the workflow on the push of a version git tag such as `app-v0.7.0`:

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'app-v*'
```

For a full list of possible trigger configurations, check out the official [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

## Example Workflow

Below is an example workflow that has been set up to run every time you push to the `release` branch.

This workflow will build and release your app for Linux x64, Windows x64, macOS x64 and macOS Arm64 (M1 and above).

The steps this workflow takes are:

1. Checkout the repository using `actions/checkout@v4`.
2. Install Linux system dependencies required to build the app.
3. Set up Node.js LTS and a cache for global npm/yarn/pnpm package data using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
4. Set up Rust and a cache for Rust's build artifacts using `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` and `swatinem/rust-cache@v2`.
5. Install the frontend dependencies and, if not configured as [`beforeBuildCommand`](/reference/config/#beforebuildcommand), run the web app's build script.
6. Lastly, it uses `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0` to run `tauri build`, generate the artifacts, and create a GitHub release.

```yaml

:::caution

Carefully read through the [Usage limits, billing, and administration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration) documentation for GitHub Actions.

## Arm Runner Compilation

This workflow uses [`pguyot/arm-runner-action`](https://github.com/pguyot/arm-runner-action) to compile directly on an emulated Arm runner. This bridges the gap for missing cross-architecture build support in the AppImage tooling.

:::danger
`arm-runner-action` is **much** slower than GitHub's standard runners, so be careful in private repositories where you're invoiced for build minutes. An uncached build for a fresh `create-tauri-app` project needs ~1 hour.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Environment Token

The GitHub Token is automatically issued by GitHub for each workflow run without further configuration, which means there is no risk of secret leakage. This token however only has read permissions by default and you may get a "Resource not accessible by integration" error when running the workflow. If this happens, you may need to add write permissions to this token. To do this, go to your GitHub project settings, select `Actions`, scroll down to `Workflow permissions`, and check "Read and write permissions".

You can see the GitHub Token being passed to the workflow via this line in the workflow:

```yaml
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

# RPM

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

# Packaging for RPM

:::note
Some sections in this guide are optional. This includes configuring scripts and certain other steps. Feel free to adapt the instructions based on your specific needs and requirements.
:::

This guide covers how to distribute and manage RPM packages, including retrieving package information, configuring scripts, setting dependencies, and signing packages.

## Configuring the RPM package

Tauri allows you to configure the RPM package by adding scripts, setting dependencies, adding a license, including custom files, and more.
For detailed information about configurable options, please refer to: [RpmConfig](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/config/#rpmconfig).

### Add post, pre-install/remove script to the package

The RPM package manager allows you to run scripts before or after the installation or removal of the package. For example, you can use these scripts to start a service after the package is installed.

Here's an example of how to add these scripts:

1. Create a folder named `scripts` in the `src-tauri` directory in your project.

```bash
mkdir src-tauri/scripts
```

2. Create the script files in the folder.

```bash
touch src-tauri/scripts/postinstall.sh \
touch src-tauri/scripts/preinstall.sh \
touch src-tauri/scripts/preremove.sh \
touch src-tauri/scripts/postremove.sh
```

Now if we look inside `/src-tauri/scripts` we will see:

```bash
ls src-tauri/scripts/
postinstall.sh  postremove.sh  preinstall.sh  preremove.sh
```

3. Add some content to the scripts

```bash title="preinstall.sh"
echo "-------------"
echo "This is pre"
echo "Install Value: $1"
echo "Upgrade Value: $1"
echo "Uninstall Value: $1"
echo "-------------"
```

```bash title="postinstall.sh"
echo "-------------"
echo "This is post"
echo "Install Value: $1"
echo "Upgrade Value: $1"
echo "Uninstall Value: $1"
echo "-------------"
```

```bash title="preremove.sh"
echo "-------------"
echo "This is preun"
echo "Install Value: $1"
echo "Upgrade Value: $1"
echo "Uninstall Value: $1"
echo "-------------"
```

```bash title="postremove.sh"
echo "-------------"
echo "This is postun"
echo "Install Value: $1"
echo "Upgrade Value: $1"
echo "Uninstall Value: $1"
echo "-------------"
```

4. Add the scripts to the`tauri.conf.json` file

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "linux": {
      "rpm": {
        "epoch": 0,
        "files": {},
        "release": "1",
        // add the script here
        "preInstallScript": "/path/to/your/project/src-tauri/scripts/prescript.sh",
        "postInstallScript": "/path/to/your/project/src-tauri/scripts/postscript.sh",
        "preRemoveScript": "/path/to/your/project/src-tauri/scripts/prescript.sh",
        "postRemoveScript": "/path/to/your/project/src-tauri/scripts/postscript.sh"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Setting the Conflict, Provides, Depends, Files, Obsoletes, DesktopTemplate, and Epoch

- **conflict**: Prevents the installation of the package if it conflicts with another package.
  For example, if you update an RPM package that your app depends on and the new version is incompatible with your app.

- **provides**: Lists the RPM dependencies that your application provides.

- **depends**: Lists the RPM dependencies that your application needs to run.

- **files**: Specifies which files to include in the package.

- **obsoletes**: Lists the RPM dependencies that your application obsoletes.

:::note
If this package is installed, packages listed as “obsoletes” will be automatically removed
if present.
:::

- **desktopTemplate**: Adds a custom desktop file to the package.

- **epoch**: Defines weighted dependencies based on version numbers.

:::caution
It is not recommended to use epoch unless necessary, as it alters how the package manager compares package versions.
For more information about epoch, please check: [RPM Packaging Guide](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io/#epoch-scriptlets-and-triggers).
:::

To use these options, add the following to your `tauri.conf.json` :

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "linux": {
      "rpm": {
        "postRemoveScript": "/path/to/your/project/src-tauri/scripts/postscript.sh",
        "conflicts": ["oldLib.rpm"],
        "depends": ["newLib.rpm"],
        "obsoletes": ["veryoldLib.rpm"],
        "provides": ["coolLib.rpm"],
        "desktopTemplate": "/path/to/your/project/src-tauri/desktop-template.desktop"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Add a license to the package

To add a license to the package, add the following to the `src-tauri/cargo.toml` or in the `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file:

```toml title="src-tauri/cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "tauri-app"
version = "0.0.0"
description = "A Tauri App"
authors = ["you"]
edition = "2021"
license = "MIT" # add the license here
# ...  rest of the file
```

And for `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "licenseFile": "../LICENSE", // put the path to the license file here
    "license": "MIT" // add the license here
  }
}
```

## Building the RPM package

To build the RPM package, you can use the following command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build"
  yarn="yarn tauri build"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build"
  deno="deno task tauri build"
  bun="bun tauri build"
  cargo="cargo tauri build"
/>

This command will build the RPM package in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/rpm` directory.

## Signing the RPM package

Tauri allows you to sign the package with the key you have in your system during the build process.
To do this, you will need to generate a GPG key.

#### Generate a GPG key

To generate a GPG key you can use the following command:

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

Follow the instruction to generate the key.

Once the key is generated, you will need to add it to your environment variable.
You can do this by adding the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc file or just export it in the terminal:

```bash
export TAURI_SIGNING_RPM_KEY=$(cat /home/johndoe/my_super_private.key)
```

If you have a passphrase for the key, you can add it to the environment variable:

```bash
export TAURI_SIGNING_RPM_KEY_PASSPHRASE=password
```

Now you can build the package with the following command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build"
  yarn="yarn tauri build"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build"
  deno="deno task tauri build"
  bun="bun tauri build"
  cargo="cargo tauri build"
/>

### Verify the signature

:::note
This should be done only to test the signature locally.
:::

Before verifying the signature, you will need to create and import the public key to the RPM database:

```bash
gpg --export -a 'Tauri-App' > RPM-GPG-KEY-Tauri-App
```

```bash
sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-Tauri-App
```

Now that the key is imported, we have to edit the `~/.rpmmacros` file to utilize the key.

```bash title="~/.rpmmacros"
%_signature gpg
%_gpg_path /home/johndoe/.gnupg
%_gpg_name Tauri-App
%_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg2
%__gpg_sign_cmd %{__gpg} \
    gpg --force-v3-sigs --digest-algo=sha1 --batch --no-verbose --no-armor \
    --passphrase-fd 3 --no-secmem-warning -u "%{_gpg_name}" \
    -sbo %{__signature_filename} %{__plaintext_filename}
```

Finally, you can verify the package using the following command:

```bash
rpm  -v --checksig tauri-app-0.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

## Debugging the RPM package

In this section, we will see how to debug the RPM package by checking the content of the package
and getting information about the package.

### Getting information about the package

To get information about your package, such as the version, release, and architecture,
use the following command:

```bash
rpm -qip package_name.rpm
```

### Query specific information about the package

For example, if you want to get the name, version, release, architecture, and size of the package, use the following command:

```bash
rpm  -qp --queryformat '[%{NAME} %{VERSION} %{RELEASE} %{ARCH} %{SIZE}\n]' package_name.rpm
```

:::note
_`--queryformat`_ is a format string that can be used to get specific information about the package.
The information that can be retrieved is from the rpm -qip command.
:::

### Checking the content of the package

To check the content of the package, use the following command:

```bash
rpm -qlp package_name.rpm
```

This command will list all the files that are included in the package.

### Debugging scripts

To debug post/pre-install/remove scripts, use the following command:

```bash
rpm -qp --scripts package_name.rpm
```

This command will print the content of the scripts.

### Checking dependencies

To check the dependencies of the package, use the following command:

```bash
rpm -qp --requires package_name.rpm
```

### List packages that depend on a specific package

To list the packages that depend on a specific package, use the following command:

```bash
rpm -q --whatrequires package_name.rpm
```

### Debugging Installation Issues

If you encounter issues during the installation of an RPM package,
you can use the `-vv` (very verbose) option to get detailed output:

```bash
rpm -ivvh package_name.rpm
```

Or for an already installed package:

```bash
rpm -Uvvh package_name.rpm
```

# Android Code Signing

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To publish on the Play Store, you need to sign your app with a digital certificate.

Android App Bundles and APKs must be signed before being uploaded for distribution.

Google also provides an additional signing mechanism for Android App Bundles distributed in the Play Store.
See the [official Play App Signing documentation] for more information.

## Creating a keystore and upload key

Android signing requires a Java Keystore file that can be generated using the official `keytool` CLI:

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
  <TabItem label="macOS/Linux">
  
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows">
  
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore $env:USERPROFILE\upload-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command stores the `upload-keystore.jks` file in your home directory.
If you want to store it elsewhere, change the argument you pass to the `-keystore` parameter.

:::tip

- The `keytool` command might not be in your PATH.
  You may find it installed in the JDK that is installed with Android Studio:

<Tabs syncKey="OS">

<TabItem label="Linux">
  <Code code="/opt/android-studio/jbr/bin/keytool ...args" lang="sh" />
  **Android Studio directory path depends on your Linux distribution**
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">
  <Code
    code="/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/keytool ...args"
    lang="sh"
  />
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">
  <Code
    code="C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jbr\\bin\\keytool.exe ...args"
    lang="sh"
  />
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::

:::caution[Security Warning]

Keep the `keystore` file private; don't check it into public source control!

:::

See the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key) for more information.

## Configure the signing key

Create a file named `[project]/src-tauri/gen/android/keystore.properties` that contains a reference to your keystore:

```
password=<password defined when keytool was executed>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=<location of the key store file, such as /Users/<user name>/upload-keystore.jks or C:\\Users\\<user name>\\upload-keystore.jks>
```

:::caution[Security Warning]
Keep the `keystore.properties` file private; don't check it into public source control.
:::

You will usually generate this file in your CI/CD platform. The following snippet contains an example job step for GitHub Actions:

```yml
- name: setup Android signing
  run: |
    cd src-tauri/gen/android
    echo "keyAlias=${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS }}" > keystore.properties
    echo "password=${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD }}" >> keystore.properties
    base64 -d <<< "${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_BASE64 }}" > $RUNNER_TEMP/keystore.jks
    echo "storeFile=$RUNNER_TEMP/keystore.jks" >> keystore.properties
```

In this example the keystore was exported to base64 with `base64 -i /path/to/keystore.jks` and set as the `ANDROID_KEY_BASE64` secret.

### Configure Gradle to use the signing key

Configure gradle to use your upload key when building your app in release mode by editing the `[project]/src-tauri/gen/android/app/build.gradle.kts` file.

1.  Add the needed import at the beginning of the file:

    ```kotlin
    import java.io.FileInputStream
    ```

2.  Add the `release` signing config before the `buildTypes` block:

    ```kotlin {3-12}
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
            val keystoreProperties = Properties()
            if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
                keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
            }

            keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties["password"] as String
            storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
            storePassword = keystoreProperties["password"] as String
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        ...
    }
    ```

3.  Use the new `release` signing config in the `release` config in `buildTypes` block:

    ```kotlin {3}
    buildTypes {
        getByName("release") {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
        }
    }
    ```

Release builds of your app will now be signed automatically.

# iOS Code Signing

Code signing on iOS is required to distribute your application through the official [Apple App Store] or possibly alternative marketplaces in the European Union and in general to install and execute on end user devices.

## Prerequisites

Code signing on iOS requires enrolling to the [Apple Developer] program, which at the time of writing costs 99$ per year.
You also need an Apple device where you perform the code signing. This is required by the signing process and due to Apple's Terms and Conditions.

To distribute iOS applications you must have your bundle identifier registered in the App Store Connect,
an appropriate iOS code signing certificate and a mobile provisioning profile that links them together and enables the iOS capabilities used by your app.
These requirements can be either automatically managed by Xcode or provided manually.

## Automatic Signing

Letting Xcode manage the signing and provisioning for your app is the most convenient way to export your iOS app to be distributed.
It automatically registers your bundle identifier, manages iOS capabilities changes, and configures an appropriate certificate based on your export method.

Automatic signing is enabled by default, and uses the account configured in Xcode to authenticate when used on your local machine.\
To register your account, open the Xcode application and open the Settings page in the `Xcode > Settings` menu, switch to the Accounts tab and click the `+` icon.

To use the automatic signing in CI/CD platforms you must create an App Store Connect API key
and define the `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY` and `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH` environment variables.\
Open the [App Store Connect's Users and Access page], select the Integrations tab, click on the Add button and select a name and the Admin access.
The `APPLE_API_ISSUER` (Issuer ID) is presented above the keys table, and the `APPLE_API_KEY` is the value on the Key ID column on that table.
You also need to download the private key, which can only be done once and is only visible after a page reload (the button is shown on the table row for the newly created key).
The private key file path must be set via the `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH` environment variable.

## Manual Signing

To manually sign your iOS app you can provide the certificate and mobile provisioning profile via environment variables:

- **IOS_CERTIFICATE**: base64 representation of the certificate exported from the Keychain.
- **IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD**: password of the certificate set when exporting it from the Keychain.
- **IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION**: base64 representation of the provisioning profile.

The following sections explain how to get these values.

### Signing Certificate

After enrolling, navigate to the [Certificates] page to create a new Apple Distribution certificate.
Download the new certificate and install it to the macOS Keychain.

To export the certificate key, open the "Keychain Access" app, expand the certificate's entry,
right-click on the key item and select "Export \<key-name\>" item.
Select the path of the exported .p12 file and remember its password.

Run the following `base64` command to convert the certificate to base64 and copy it to the clipboard:

```
base64 -i <path-to-certificate.p12> | pbcopy
```

The value in the clipboard is now the base64 representation of the signing certificate.
Save it and use it as the `IOS_CERTIFICATE` environment variable value.

The certificate password must be set to the `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` variable.

:::tip[Choose Certificate Type]
You must use an appropriate certificate type for each export method:

- **debugging**: Apple Development or iOS App Development
- **app-store-connect**: Apple Distribution or iOS Distribution (App Store Connect and Ad Hoc)
- **ad-hoc**: Apple Distribution or iOS Distribution (App Store Connect and Ad Hoc)

:::

### Provisioning Profile

Additionally, you must provide the provisioning profile for your application.
In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) page,
create a new App ID and make sure its "Bundle ID" value matches the identifier set in the [`identifier`] configuration.

Navigate to the [Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list) page to create a new provisioning profile.
For App Store distribution, it must be an "App Store Connect" profile.
Select the appropriate App ID and link the certificate you previously created.

After creating the provisioning profile, download it and run the following `base64` command to convert the profile and copy it to the clipboard:

```
base64 -i <path-to-profile.mobileprovision> | pbcopy
```

The value in the clipboard is now the base64 representation of the provisioning profile.
Save it and use it as the `IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION` environment variable value.

Now you can build your iOS application and distribute on the App Store!

# Linux Code Signing

This guide provides information on code signing for Linux packages.
While artifact signing is not required for your application to be deployed on Linux,
it can be used to increase trust into your deployed application.
Signing the binaries allows your end user to verify that these are genuine and have not been modified by another untrusted entity.

## Signing for AppImages

The AppImage can be signed using either gpg or gpg2.

### Prerequisites

A key for signing must be prepared. A new one can be generated using:

```shell
gpg2 --full-gen-key
```

Please refer to the gpg or gpg2 documentation for additional information.
You should take additional care to back up your private and public keys in a secure location.

### Signing

You can embed a signature in the AppImage by setting the following environment variables:

- **SIGN**: set to `1` to sign the AppImage.
- **SIGN_KEY**: optional variable to use a specific GPG Key ID for signing.
- **APPIMAGETOOL_SIGN_PASSPHRASE**: the signing key password. If unset, gpg shows a dialog so you can input it. You must set this when building in CI/CD platforms.
- **APPIMAGETOOL_FORCE_SIGN**: by default the AppImage is generated even if signing fails. To exit on errors, you can set this variable to `1`.

You can display the signature embedded in the AppImage by running the following command:

```shell
./src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/$APPNAME_$VERSION_amd64.AppImage --appimage-signature
```

Note that you need to change the $APPNAME and $VERSION values with the correct ones based on your configuration.

:::caution

**The signature is not verified**

AppImage does not validate the signature, so you can't rely on it to check whether the file has been tampered with or not.
The user must manually verify the signature using the AppImage validate tool.
This requires you to publish your key ID on an authenticated channel (e.g. your website served via TLS),
so the end user can view and verify.

See [the official AppImage documentation] for additional information.

:::

[the official appimage documentation]: https://docs.appimage.org/packaging-guide/optional/signatures.html

### Validate the signature

The AppImage validate tool can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate/releases/tag/continuous).
Select one of the `validate-$PLATFORM.AppImage` files.

Run the following command to validate the signature:

```shell
chmod +x validate-$PLATFORM.AppImage
./validate-$PLATFORM.AppImage $TAURI_OUTPUT.AppImage
```

If the signature is valid, the output will be:

```
Validation result: validation successful
Signatures found with key fingerprints: $KEY_ID
====================
Validator report:
Signature checked for key with fingerprint $KEY_ID:
Validation successful
```

# macOS Code Signing

Code signing is required on macOS to allow your application to be listed in the [Apple App Store] and to prevent a warning that your application is broken and can not be started, when downloaded from the browser.

## Prerequisites

Code signing on macOS requires an [Apple Developer] account which is either paid (99$ per year) or on the free plan (only for testing and development purposes). You also need an Apple device where you perform the code signing. This is required by the signing process and due to Apple's Terms and Conditions.

:::note
Note when using a free Apple Developer account, you will not be able to notarize your application and it will still show up as not verified when opening the app.
:::

## Signing

To setup code signing for macOS you must create an Apple code signing certificate and
install it to your Mac computer keychain or export it to be used in CI/CD platforms.

### Creating a signing certificate

To create a new signing certificate, you must generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file from your Mac computer.
See [creating a certificate signing request] to learn how to create the CSR for code signing.

On your Apple Developer account, navigate to the [Certificates, IDs & Profiles page]
and click on the `Create a certificate` button to open the interface to create a new certificate.
Choose the appropriate certificate type (`Apple Distribution` to submit apps to the App Store, and `Developer ID Application` to ship apps outside the App Store).
Upload your CSR, and the certificate will be created.

:::note

Only the Apple Developer `Account Holder` can create _Developer ID Application_ certificates. But it can be associated with a different Apple ID by creating a CSR with a different user email address.

:::

### Downloading the certificate

On the [Certificates, IDs & Profiles page], click on the certificate you want to use and click on the `Download` button.
It saves a `.cer` file that installs the certificate on the keychain once opened.

### Configuring Tauri

You can configure Tauri to use your certificate when building macOS apps on your local machine or when using CI/CD platforms.

#### Signing locally

With the certificate installed in your Mac computer keychain, you can configure Tauri to use it for code signing.

The name of the certificate's keychain entry represents the `signing identity`, which can also be found by executing:

```sh
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

This identity can be provided in the [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > signingIdentity`] configuration option or
via the `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` environment variable.

:::note

A signing certificate is only valid if associated with your Apple ID.
An invalid certificate won't be listed on the _Keychain Access > My Certificates_ tab
or the _security find-identity -v -p codesigning_ output.
If the certificate does not download to the correct location, make sure the "login" option is selected in _Keychain Access_
under "Default Keychains" when downloading the .cer file.

:::

#### Signing in CI/CD platforms

To use the certificate in CI/CD platforms, you must export the certificate to a base64 string
and configure the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` and `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` environment variables:

1. Open the `Keychain Access` app, click the _My Certificates_ tab in the _login_ keychain and find your certificate's entry.
2. Expand the entry, right-click on the key item, and select `Export "$KEYNAME"`.
3. Select the path to save the certificate's `.p12` file and define a password for the exported certificate.
4. Convert the `.p12` file to base64 running the following script on the terminal:

```sh
openssl base64 -in /path/to/certificate.p12 -out certificate-base64.txt
```

5. Set the contents of the `certificate-base64.txt` file to the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` environment variable.
6. Set the certificate password to the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` environment variable.

<br />

<details>
<summary>Example GitHub Actions configuration</summary>

Required secrets:

- `APPLE_ID` - Your Apple ID email
- `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD` - Your Apple ID password
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` - The base64 encoded `.p12` file
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` - The password for your exported `.p12` file
- `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` - The password for your keychain

## Notarization

To notarize your application, you must provide credentials for Tauri to authenticate with Apple:

- APPLE_API_ISSUER, APPLE_API_KEY and APPLE_API_KEY_PATH: authenticate using an App Store Connect API key

  Open the [App Store Connect's Users and Access page], select the Integrations tab, click on the Add button and select a name and the Developer access.
  The APPLE_API_ISSUER (Issuer ID) is presented above the keys table, and the APPLE_API_KEY is the value on the Key ID column on that table.
  You also need to download the private key, which can only be done once and is only visible after a page reload (the button is shown on the table row for the newly created key).
  The private key file path must be set via the APPLE_API_KEY_PATH environment variable.

- APPLE_ID, APPLE_PASSWORD and APPLE_TEAM_ID: authenticate using your Apple ID

  Alternatively, to authenticate with your Apple ID, set the APPLE_ID to your Apple account email and the APPLE_PASSWORD to an [app-specific password] for the Apple account.

:::note
Notarization is required when using a _Developer ID Application_ certificate.

## Ad-Hoc Signing

If you do not wish to provide an Apple-authenticated identity, but still wish to sign your application, you can configure an _ad-hoc_ signature.

This is useful on ARM (Apple Silicon) devices, where code-signing is required for all apps from the Internet.

:::caution
Ad-hoc code signing does not prevent MacOS from requiring users to
[whitelist the installation in their Privacy & Security settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac).
:::

To configure an ad-hoc signature, provide the pseudo-identity `-` to Tauri, e.g.

```json
"signingIdentity": "-"
```

For details on configuring Tauri's signing identity, see [above](#configuring-tauri).

# Windows Code Signing

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Code signing is required on Windows to allow your application to be listed in the [Microsoft Store] and to prevent a [SmartScreen] warning that your application is not trusted and can not be started, when downloaded from the browser.

It is not required to execute your application on Windows, as long as your end user is okay with ignoring the [SmartScreen] warning or your user does not download via the browser.
This guide covers signing via OV (Organization Validated) certificates and Azure Key Vault.
If you use any other signing mechanism not documented here, such as EV (Extended Validation) certificates,
check out your certificate issuer documentation and refer to the [custom sign command](#custom-sign-command) section.

## OV Certificates

:::danger

This guide only applies to OV code signing certificates acquired before June 1st 2023! For code signing with EV certificates and OV certificates received after that date please consult the documentation of your certificate issuer instead.

:::

:::note

If you sign the app with an EV Certificate, it'll receive an immediate reputation with Microsoft SmartScreen and won't show any warnings to users.

If you opt for an OV Certificate, which is generally cheaper and available to individuals, Microsoft SmartScreen will still show a warning to users when they download the app. It might take some time until your certificate builds enough reputation. You may opt for [submitting your app] to Microsoft for manual review. Although not guaranteed, if the app does not contain any malicious code, Microsoft may grant additional reputation and potentially remove the warning for that specific uploaded file.

See the [comparison](https://www.digicert.com/difference-between-dv-ov-and-ev-ssl-certificates) to learn more about OV vs EV certificates.

:::

### Prerequisites

- Windows - you can likely use other platforms, but this tutorial uses Powershell native features.
- A working Tauri application
- Code signing certificate - you can acquire one of these on services listed in [Microsoft's docs]. There are likely additional authorities for non-EV certificates than included in that list, please compare them yourself and choose one at your own risk.
  - Please make sure to get a **code signing** certificate, SSL certificates do not work!

### Getting Started

There are a few things we have to do to get Windows prepared for code signing. This includes converting our certificate to a specific format, installing this certificate, and decoding the required information from the certificate.

<Steps>

1. #### Convert your `.cer` to `.pfx`

   - You will need the following:

     - certificate file (mine is `cert.cer`)
     - private key file (mine is `private-key.key`)

   - Open up a command prompt and change to your current directory using `cd Documents/Certs`

   - Convert your `.cer` to a `.pfx` using `openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.cer -inkey private-key.key -out certificate.pfx`

   - You should be prompted to enter an export password **DON'T FORGET IT!**

2. #### Import your `.pfx` file into the keystore.

   - We now need to import our `.pfx` file.

   - Assign your export password to a variable using `$WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD = 'MYPASSWORD'`

   - Now Import the certificate using `Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath certificate.pfx -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String $WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD -Force -AsPlainText)`

3. #### Prepare Variables

   - Start ➡️ `certmgr.msc` to open Personal Certificate Management, then open Personal/Certificates.

   - Find the certificate we just imported and double-click on it, then click on the Details tab.

   - The Signature hash algorithm will be our `digestAlgorithm`. (Hint: this is likely `sha256`)

   - Scroll down to Thumbprint. There should be a value like `A1B1A2B2A3B3A4B4A5B5A6B6A7B7A8B8A9B9A0B0`. This is our `certificateThumbprint`.

   - We also need a timestamp URL; this is a time server used to verify the time of the certificate signing. I'm using `http://timestamp.comodoca.com`, but whoever you got your certificate from likely has one as well.

</Steps>

### Prepare `tauri.conf.json` file

1. Now that we have our `certificateThumbprint`, `digestAlgorithm`, & `timestampUrl` we will open up the `tauri.conf.json`.

2. In the `tauri.conf.json` you will look for the `tauri` -> `bundle` -> `windows` section. There are three variables for the information we have captured. Fill it out like below.

```json tauri.conf.json
"windows": {
        "certificateThumbprint": "A1B1A2B2A3B3A4B4A5B5A6B6A7B7A8B8A9B9A0B0",
        "digestAlgorithm": "sha256",
        "timestampUrl": "http://timestamp.comodoca.com"
}
```

3. Save and run `tauri build`

4. In the console output, you should see the following output.

```
info: signing app
info: running signtool "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.19041.0\\x64\\signtool.exe"
info: "Done Adding Additional Store\r\nSuccessfully signed: APPLICATION FILE PATH HERE
```

Which shows you have successfully signed the `.exe`.

And that's it! You have successfully set up your Tauri application for Windows signing.

### Sign your application with GitHub Actions.

We can also create a workflow to sign the application with GitHub actions.

#### GitHub Secrets

We need to add a few GitHub secrets for the proper configuration of the GitHub Action. These can be named however you would like.

- You can view the [encrypted secrets] guide on how to add GitHub secrets.

The secrets we used are as follows

|        GitHub Secrets        |                                                        Value for Variable                                                         |
| :--------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|     WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE      | Base64 encoded version of your .pfx certificate, can be done using this command `certutil -encode certificate.pfx base64cert.txt` |
| WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD |                                 Certificate export password used on creation of certificate .pfx                                  |

#### Workflow Modifications

1. We need to add a step in the workflow to import the certificate into the Windows environment. This workflow accomplishes the following

   1. Assign GitHub secrets to environment variables
   2. Create a new `certificate` directory
   3. Import `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` into tempCert.txt
   4. Use `certutil` to decode the tempCert.txt from base64 into a `.pfx` file.
   5. Remove tempCert.txt
   6. Import the `.pfx` file into the Cert store of Windows & convert the `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` to a secure string to be used in the import command.

2. We will be using the [`tauri-action` publish template].

```yml
name: 'publish'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  publish-tauri:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
      - name: install Rust stable
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
      - name: install webkit2gtk (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-latest'
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y webkit2gtk-4.0
      - name: install app dependencies and build it
        run: yarn && yarn build
      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__ # the action automatically replaces \_\_VERSION\_\_ with the app version
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
```

3. Right above `-name: install app dependencies and build it` you will want to add the following step

```yml
- name: import windows certificate
  if: matrix.platform == 'windows-latest'
  env:
    WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE: ${{ secrets.WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE }}
    WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD }}
  run: |
    New-Item -ItemType directory -Path certificate
    Set-Content -Path certificate/tempCert.txt -Value $env:WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE
    certutil -decode certificate/tempCert.txt certificate/certificate.pfx
    Remove-Item -path certificate -include tempCert.txt
    Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath certificate/certificate.pfx -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String $env:WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD -Force -AsPlainText)
```

4. Save and push to your repo.

5. Your workflow can now import your windows certificate and import it into the GitHub runner, allowing for automated code signing!

## Azure Key Vault

You can sign the Windows executables by providing an Azure Key Vault certificate and credentials.

:::note
This guide uses [relic] due to its support to secret-based authentication, though you can configure alternative tools if you prefer.
To download relic, check its [releases page][relic releases page] or run `go install github.com/sassoftware/relic/v8@latest`.
:::

1. Key Vault

In the [Azure Portal] navigate to the [Key vaults service] to create a new key vault by clicking the "Create" button.
Remember the "Key vault name" as you will need that information to configure the certificate URL.

2. Certificate

After creating a key vault, select it and go to the "Objects > Certificates" page to create a new certificate and click the "Generate/Import" button.
Remember the "Certificate name" as you will need that information to configure the certificate URL.

3. Tauri Configuration

[relic] uses a configuration file to determine which signing key it should use. For Azure Key Vault you also need the certificate URL.
Create a `relic.conf` file in the `src-tauri` folder and configure relic to use your certificate:

```yml title=src-tauri/relic.conf
tokens:
  azure:
    type: azure

keys:
  azure:
    token: azure
    id: https://\<KEY_VAULT_NAME\>.vault.azure.net/certificates/\<CERTIFICATE_NAME\>
```

Note that you must replace \<KEY_VAULT_NAME\> and \<CERTIFICATE_NAME\> with the appropriate names from the previous steps.

To configure Tauri to use your Azure Key Vault configuration for signing change the [bundle > windows > signCommand] config value:

```json title=tauri.conf.json
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "signCommand": "relic sign --file %1 --key azure --config relic.conf"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Credentials

[relic] must authenticate with Azure in order to load the certificate.
In the Azure portal landing page, go to the "Microsoft Entra ID" service and head to the "Manage > App registrations" page.
Click "New registration" to create a new app. After creating the app, you are redirected to the application details page where you can see the "Application (client) ID" and "Directory (tenant) ID" values.
Set these IDs to the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variables respectively.

In the "Manage > Certificates & secrets" page click the "New client secret" button and set the text in the "Value" column as the `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.

After setting up all the credentials, head back to your key vault's page and navigate to the "Access control (IAM)" page.
You must assign the "Key Vault Certificate User" and "Key Vault Crypto User" roles to your newly created application.

After setting up all these variables, running `tauri build` will produce signed Windows installers!

## Custom Sign Command

In the [Azure Key Vault](#azure-key-vault) documentation above we used a powerful Tauri Windows signing configuration to force the Tauri CLI to use
a special shell command to sign Windows installer executables. The [bundle > windows > signCommand] configuration option can be used to use any codesign tool
that can sign Windows executables.

:::tip
When cross compiling Windows installers from Linux and macOS machines, you **must** use a custom sign command as the default implementation only works on Windows machines.

## Azure Code Signing

You can sign the Windows executables by providing an Azure Code signing certificate and credentials. If you don't have an Azure Code signing Account yet you can follow this [tutorial](https://melatonin.dev/blog/code-signing-on-windows-with-azure-trusted-signing/).

### Prerequisites

If you want to sign with Github Actions everything should be installed.

1. [Trusted Signing Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/quickstart?tabs=registerrp-portal,account-portal,certificateprofile-portal,deleteresources-portal) and permissions configured
1. [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (.NET 6 or later recommended)
1. [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli#install-or-update)
1. [Signtool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/signtool-exe) (Windows 11 SDK 10.0.22000.0 or later recommended)

### Getting Started

You need to install [trusted-signing-cli](https://github.com/Levminer/trusted-signing-cli) and configure your environment variables.

<Steps>

1. #### Install trusted-signing-cli

   - `cargo install trusted-signing-cli`

2. #### Configure environment variables

   - trusted-signing-cli needs the following environment variables to be set, don't forget to add these as Github Actions [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions):

     - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of your [App Registration](https://melatonin.dev/blog/code-signing-on-windows-with-azure-trusted-signing/#step-4-create-app-registration-user-credentials)
     - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret of [App Registration](https://melatonin.dev/blog/code-signing-on-windows-with-azure-trusted-signing/#step-4-create-app-registration-user-credentials)
     - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: The tenant ID of your Azure directory, you can also get this from your [App Registration](https://melatonin.dev/blog/code-signing-on-windows-with-azure-trusted-signing/#step-4-create-app-registration-user-credentials)

3. ### Modify your `tauri.conf.json` file

   - You can modify your `tauri.conf.json` or you can create a specific config file for Windows. Replace the URL and the certificate name with your own values.

     - -e: The endpoint of your Azure Code Signing account
     - -a: The name of your Azure Code Signing Account
     - -c: The name of your Certificate profile inside your Azure Code Signing Account
     - -d: The description of the signed content (optional). When signing a .msi installer, this description will appear as the installer's name in the UAC prompt or will be a random string of characters if unset.

   ```json title=tauri.conf.json
   {
     "bundle": {
       "windows": {
         "signCommand": "trusted-signing-cli -e https://wus2.codesigning.azure.net -a MyAccount -c MyProfile -d MyApp %1"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

  </Steps>

### Explanation

- The `name` variable defines the name of your app and is required to be set to the name that you have registered earlier.
- The `base` variable defines which core you are using.
- The `version` variable defines the version, and should be updated with each change to the source repository.
- The `apps` section allows you to expose the desktop and binary files to allow the user to run your app.
- The `package-repositories` section allows you to add a package repository to help you satisfy your dependencies.
- `build-packages`/`build-snaps` defines the build dependencies for your snap.
- `stage-packages`/`stage-snaps` defines the runtime dependencies for your snap.
- The `override-pull` section runs a series of commands before the sources are pulled.
- `craftctl default` performs the default pull commands.
- The `organize` section moves your files to the proper directories so that the binary and desktop file can be exposed to the `apps` sections.

## Building

```sh
sudo snapcraft
```

# Windows Installer

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tauri applications for Windows are either distributed as Microsoft Installers (`.msi` files) using the [WiX Toolset v3]
or as setup executables (`-setup.exe` files) using [NSIS].

Please note that `.msi` installers can **only be created on Windows** as cross-compilation doesn't work.
Cross-compilation for NSIS installers is currently experimental.

This guide provides information about available customization options for the installer.

## Building

To build and bundle your app into a Windows installer you can use the Tauri CLI and run the `tauri build` command in a Windows computer:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build"
  yarn="yarn tauri build"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build"
  deno="deno task tauri build"
  bun="bun tauri build"
  cargo="cargo tauri build"
/>

:::note[VBSCRIPT requirement for MSI packages]
Building MSI packages (`"targets": "msi"` or `"targets": "all"` in `tauri.conf.json`) requires the VBSCRIPT optional feature to be enabled on Windows. This feature is enabled by default on most Windows installations, but if you encounter errors like `failed to run light.exe`, you may need to enable it manually through **Settings** → **Apps** → **Optional features** → **More Windows features**. See the [Prerequisites guide](/start/prerequisites/#vbscript-for-msi-installers) for detailed instructions.
:::

### Experimental: Build Windows apps on Linux and macOS

Cross compiling Windows apps on Linux and macOS hosts is possible when using [NSIS].
Note that this is currently considered highly experimental and may not work on every system or for every project.
Therefore it should only be used as a last resort if local VMs or CI solutions like GitHub Actions don't work for you.

:::note
Signing cross compiled Windows installers requires an external signing tool.
See the [signing documentation] for more information.
:::

Since Tauri officially only supports the MSVC Windows target, the setup is a bit more involved.

#### Install NSIS

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
<TabItem label="Linux">
Some Linux distributions have NSIS available in their repositories, for example on Ubuntu you can install NSIS by running this command:

```sh title=Ubuntu
sudo apt install nsis
```

But on many other distributions you have to compile NSIS yourself or download Stubs and Plugins manually that weren't included in the distro's binary package.
Fedora for example only provides the binary but not the Stubs and Plugins:

```sh title=Fedora
sudo dnf in mingw64-nsis
wget https://github.com/tauri-apps/binary-releases/releases/download/nsis-3/nsis-3.zip
unzip nsis-3.zip
sudo cp nsis-3.08/Stubs/* /usr/share/nsis/Stubs/
sudo cp -r nsis-3.08/Plugins/** /usr/share/nsis/Plugins/
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">
On macOS you will need [Homebrew] to install NSIS:

```sh title=macOS
brew install nsis
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Install LLVM and the LLD Linker

Since the default Microsoft linker only works on Windows we will also need to install a new linker.
To compile the Windows Resource file which is used for setting the app icon among other things
we will also need the `llvm-rc` binary which is part of the LLVM project.

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
<TabItem label="Linux">
  
```sh title="Ubuntu"
sudo apt install lld llvm
```

On Linux you also need to install the `clang` package if you added dependencies that compile C/C++ dependencies as part of their build scripts.
Default Tauri apps should not require this.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS">
```sh title=macOS
brew install llvm
```

On macOS you also have to add `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin` to your `$PATH` as suggested in the install output.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Install the Windows Rust target

Assuming you're building for 64-bit Windows systems:

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

#### Install `cargo-xwin`

Instead of setting the Windows SDKs up manually we will use [`cargo-xwin`] as Tauri's "runner":

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-xwin
```

By default `cargo-xwin` will download the Windows SDKs into a project-local folder.
If you have multiple projects and want to share those files you can set the `XWIN_CACHE_DIR` environment variable with a path to the preferred location.

#### Building the App

Now it should be as simple as adding the runner and target to the `tauri build` command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  deno="deno task tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  bun="bun tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
/>

The build output will then be in `target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/nsis/`.

### Building for 32-bit or ARM

The Tauri CLI compiles your executable using your machine's architecture by default.
Assuming that you're developing on a 64-bit machine, the CLI will produce 64-bit applications.

If you need to support **32-bit** machines, you can compile your application with a **different** [Rust target][platform support]
using the `--target` flag:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  deno="deno task tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  bun="bun tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
/>

By default, Rust only installs toolchains for your machine's target,
so you need to install the 32-bit Windows toolchain first: `rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc`.

If you need to build for **ARM64** you first need to install additional build tools.
To do this, open `Visual Studio Installer`, click on "Modify", and in the "Individual Components" tab install the "C++ ARM64 build tools".
At the time of writing, the exact name in VS2022 is `MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools (Latest)`.  
Now you can add the rust target with `rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` and then use the above-mentioned method to compile your app:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build -- --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  deno="deno task tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  bun="bun tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
/>

:::info

Note that the NSIS installer itself will still be x86 running on the ARM machine via emulation. The app itself will be a native ARM64 binary.

:::

## Supporting Windows 7

By default, the Microsoft Installer (`.msi`) does not work on Windows 7 because it needs to download the WebView2 bootstrapper if not installed
(which might fail if TLS 1.2 is not enabled in the operating system). Tauri includes an option to embed the WebView2 bootstrapper
(see the [Embedding the WebView2 Bootstrapper](#embedded-bootstrapper) section below).
The NSIS based installer (`-setup.exe`) also supports the `downloadBootstrapper` mode on Windows 7.

Additionally, to use the Notification API in Windows 7, you need to enable the `windows7-compat` Cargo feature:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-notification = { version = "2.0.0", features = [ "windows7-compat" ] }
```

## FIPS Compliance

If your system requires the MSI bundle to be FIPS compliant you can set the `TAURI_BUNDLER_WIX_FIPS_COMPLIANT` environment variable to `true`
before running `tauri build`. In PowerShell you can set it for the current terminal session like this:

```powershell
$env:TAURI_BUNDLER_WIX_FIPS_COMPLIANT="true"
```

## WebView2 Installation Options

The installers by default download the WebView2 bootstrapper and executes it if the runtime is not installed.
Alternatively, you can embed the bootstrapper, embed the offline installer, or use a fixed WebView2 runtime version.
See the following table for a comparison between these methods:

| Installation Method                                | Requires Internet Connection? | Additional Installer Size | Notes                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`downloadBootstrapper`](#downloaded-bootstrapper) | Yes                           | 0MB                       | `Default` <br /> Results in a smaller installer size, but is not recommended for Windows 7 deployment via `.msi` files. |
| [`embedBootstrapper`](#embedded-bootstrapper)      | Yes                           | ~1.8MB                    | Better support on Windows 7 for `.msi` installers.                                                                      |
| [`offlineInstaller`](#offline-installer)           | No                            | ~127MB                    | Embeds WebView2 installer. Recommended for offline environments.                                                        |
| [`fixedVersion`](#fixed-version)                   | No                            | ~180MB                    | Embeds a fixed WebView2 version.                                                                                        |
| [`skip`](#skipping-installation)                   | No                            | 0MB                       | ⚠️ Not recommended <br /> Does not install the WebView2 as part of the Windows Installer.                               |

:::info

On Windows 10 (April 2018 release or later) and Windows 11, the WebView2 runtime is distributed as part of the operating system.

:::

### Downloaded Bootstrapper

This is the default setting for building the Windows Installer. It downloads the bootstrapper and runs it.
Requires an internet connection but results in a smaller installer size.
This is not recommended if you're going to be distributing to Windows 7 via `.msi` installers.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "downloadBootstrapper"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Embedded Bootstrapper

To embed the WebView2 Bootstrapper, set the [webviewInstallMode] to `embedBootstrapper`.
This increases the installer size by around 1.8MB, but increases compatibility with Windows 7 systems.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "embedBootstrapper"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Offline Installer

To embed the WebView2 Bootstrapper, set the [webviewInstallMode] to `offlineInstaller`.
This increases the installer size by around 127MB, but allows your application to be installed even if an internet connection is not available.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "offlineInstaller"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fixed Version

Using the runtime provided by the system is great for security as the webview vulnerability patches are managed by Windows.
If you want to control the WebView2 distribution on each of your applications
(either to manage the release patches yourself or distribute applications on environments where an internet connection might not be available)
Tauri can bundle the runtime files for you.

:::caution

Distributing a fixed WebView2 Runtime version increases the Windows Installer by around 180MB.

:::

1. Download the WebView2 fixed version runtime from [Microsoft's website][download-webview2-runtime].
   In this example, the downloaded filename is `Microsoft.WebView2.FixedVersionRuntime.128.0.2739.42.x64.cab`
2. Extract the file to the core folder:

```powershell
Expand .\Microsoft.WebView2.FixedVersionRuntime.128.0.2739.42.x64.cab -F:* ./src-tauri
```

3. Configure the WebView2 runtime path in `tauri.conf.json`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "fixedRuntime",
        "path": "./Microsoft.WebView2.FixedVersionRuntime.98.0.1108.50.x64/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Run `tauri build` to produce the Windows Installer with the fixed WebView2 runtime.

### Skipping Installation

You can remove the WebView2 Runtime download check from the installer by setting [webviewInstallMode] to `skip`.
Your application WILL NOT work if the user does not have the runtime installed.

:::warning

Your application WILL NOT work if the user does not have the runtime installed and won't attempt to install it.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "skip"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Customizing the WiX Installer

See the [WiX configuration] for the complete list of customization options.

### Installer Template

The `.msi` Windows Installer package is built using the [WiX Toolset v3].
Currently, apart from pre-defined [configurations][WiX configuration], you can change it by using a custom WiX source code
(an XML file with a `.wxs` file extension) or through WiX fragments.

#### Replacing the Installer Code with a Custom WiX File

The Windows Installer XML defined by Tauri is configured to work for the common use case
of simple webview-based applications (you can find it [here][default wix template]).
It uses [handlebars] so the Tauri CLI can brand your installer according to your `tauri.conf.json` definition.
If you need a completely different installer, a custom template file can be configured on [`tauri.bundle.windows.wix.template`].

#### Extending the Installer with WiX Fragments

A [WiX fragment] is a container where you can configure almost everything offered by WiX.
In this example, we will define a fragment that writes two registry entries:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Wix xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/wi">
  <Fragment>
    <!-- these registry entries should be installed
		 to the target user's machine -->
    <DirectoryRef Id="TARGETDIR">
      <!-- groups together the registry entries to be installed -->
      <!-- Note the unique `Id` we provide here -->
      <Component Id="MyFragmentRegistryEntries" Guid="*">
        <!-- the registry key will be under
			 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MyCompany\MyApplicationName -->
        <!-- Tauri uses the second portion of the
			 bundle identifier as the `MyCompany` name
			 (e.g. `tauri-apps` in `com.tauri-apps.test`)  -->
        <RegistryKey
          Root="HKCU"
          Key="Software\MyCompany\MyApplicationName"
          Action="createAndRemoveOnUninstall"
        >
          <!-- values to persist on the registry -->
          <RegistryValue
            Type="integer"
            Name="SomeIntegerValue"
            Value="1"
            KeyPath="yes"
          />
          <RegistryValue Type="string" Value="Default Value" />
        </RegistryKey>
      </Component>
    </DirectoryRef>
  </Fragment>
</Wix>
```

Save the fragment file with the `.wxs` extension in the `src-tauri/windows/fragments` folder and reference it on `tauri.conf.json`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "fragmentPaths": ["./windows/fragments/registry.wxs"],
        "componentRefs": ["MyFragmentRegistryEntries"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that `ComponentGroup`, `Component`, `FeatureGroup`, `Feature` and `Merge` element ids must be referenced on the `wix` object
of `tauri.conf.json` on the `componentGroupRefs`, `componentRefs`, `featureGroupRefs`, `featureRefs` and `mergeRefs`
respectively to be included in the installer.

### Internationalization

The WiX Installer is built using the `en-US` language by default.
Internationalization (i18n) can be configured using the [`tauri.bundle.windows.wix.language`] property,
defining the languages Tauri should build an installer against.
You can find the language names to use in the Language-Culture column on [Microsoft's website][localizing the error and actiontext tables].

#### Compiling a WiX Installer for a Single Language

To create a single installer targeting a specific language, set the `language` value to a string:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "language": "fr-FR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Compiling a WiX Installer for Each Language in a List

To compile an installer targeting a list of languages, use an array.
A specific installer for each language will be created, with the language key as a suffix:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "language": ["en-US", "pt-BR", "fr-FR"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuring the WiX Installer Strings for Each Language

A configuration object can be defined for each language to configure localization strings:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "language": {
          "en-US": null,
          "pt-BR": {
            "localePath": "./wix/locales/pt-BR.wxl"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `localePath` property defines the path to a language file, a XML configuring the language culture:

```xml
<WixLocalization
  Culture="en-US"
  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/localization"
>
  <String Id="LaunchApp"> Launch MyApplicationName </String>
  <String Id="DowngradeErrorMessage">
    A newer version of MyApplicationName is already installed.
  </String>
  <String Id="PathEnvVarFeature">
    Add the install location of the MyApplicationName executable to
    the PATH system environment variable. This allows the
    MyApplicationName executable to be called from any location.
  </String>
  <String Id="InstallAppFeature">
    Installs MyApplicationName.
  </String>
</WixLocalization>
```

:::note

The `WixLocalization` element's `Culture` field must match the configured language.

:::

Currently, Tauri references the following locale strings: `LaunchApp`, `DowngradeErrorMessage`, `PathEnvVarFeature` and `InstallAppFeature`.
You can define your own strings and reference them on your custom template or fragments with `"!(loc.TheStringId)"`.
See the [WiX localization documentation] for more information.

## Customizing the NSIS Installer

See the [NSIS configuration] for the complete list of customization options.

### Installer Template

The NSIS Installer's `.nsi` script defined by Tauri is configured to work for the common use case
of simple webview-based applications (you can find it [here][default nsis template]).
It uses [handlebars] so the Tauri CLI can brand your installer according to your `tauri.conf.json` definition.
If you need a completely different installer, a custom template file can be configured on [`tauri.bundle.windows.nsis.template`].

### Extending the Installer

If you only need to extend some installation steps you might be able to use installer hooks instead of replacing the entire installer template.

Supported hooks are:

- `NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL`: Runs before copying files, setting registry key values and creating shortcuts.
- `NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL`: Runs after the installer has finished copying all files, setting the registry keys and created shortcuts.
- `NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL`: Runs before removing any files, registry keys and shortcuts.
- `NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL`: Runs after files, registry keys and shortcuts have been removed.

For example, create a `hooks.nsh` file in the `src-tauri/windows` folder and define the hooks you need:

```nsh
!macro NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PreInstall"
!macroend

!macro NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PostInstall"
!macroend

!macro NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PreUnInstall"
!macroend

!macro NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PostUninstall"
!macroend
```

Then you must configure Tauri to use that hook file:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "installerHooks": "./windows/hooks.nsh"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Installing Dependencies with Hooks

You can use installer hooks to automatically install system dependencies that your application requires. This is particularly useful for runtime dependencies like Visual C++ Redistributables, DirectX, OpenSSL or other system libraries that may not be present on all Windows systems.

**MSI Installer Example (Visual C++ Redistributable):**

```nsh
!macro NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL
  ; Check if Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable is installed (via Windows Registry)
  ReadRegDWord $0 HKLM "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\VC\Runtimes\x64" "Installed"

  ${If} $0 == 1
    DetailPrint "Visual C++ Redistributable already installed"
    Goto vcredist_done
  ${EndIf}

  ; Install from bundled MSI if not installed
  ${If} ${FileExists} "$INSTDIR\resources\vc_redist.x64.msi"
    DetailPrint "Installing Visual C++ Redistributable..."
    ; Copy to TEMP folder and then execute installer
    CopyFiles "$INSTDIR\resources\vc_redist.x64.msi" "$TEMP\vc_redist.x64.msi"
    ExecWait 'msiexec /i "$TEMP\vc_redist.x64.msi" /passive /norestart' $0

    ; Check wether installation process exited successfully (code 0) or not
    ${If} $0 == 0
      DetailPrint "Visual C++ Redistributable installed successfully"
    ${Else}
      MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "Visual C++ installation failed. Some features may not work."
    ${EndIf}

    ; Clean up setup files from TEMP and your installed app
    Delete "$TEMP\vc_redist.x64.msi"
    Delete "$INSTDIR\resources\vc_redist.x64.msi"
  ${EndIf}

  vcredist_done:
!macroend
```

**Key considerations:**

- A good practice is to always check if the dependency is already installed using registry keys or file existence or via Windows [where] command.
- Use `/passive`, `/quiet`, or `/silent` flags to avoid interrupting the installation flow. Check out [msiexec] options for `.msi` files, or the setup manual for app-specific flags
- Include `/norestart` to prevent automatic system reboots during installation for setups that restarts user devices
- Clean up temporary files and bundled installers to avoid bloating the application
- Consider that dependencies might be shared with other applications when uninstalling
- Provide meaningful error messages if installation fails

Ensure to bundle the dependency installers in your `src-tauri/resources` folder and add to `tauri.conf.json` so they get bundled, and can be accessed during installation from `$INSTDIR\resources\`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "resources": [
      "resources/my-dependency.exe",
      "resources/another-one.msi
    ]
  }
}
```

### Install Modes

By default the installer will install your application for the current user only.
The advantage of this option is that the installer does not require Administrator privileges to run,
but the app is installed in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` folder instead of `C:/Program Files`.

If you prefer your app installation to be available system-wide (which requires Administrator privileges)
you can set [installMode] to `perMachine`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "installMode": "perMachine"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively you can let the user choose whether the app should be installed for the current user only or system-wide
by setting the [installMode] to `both`.
Note that the installer will require Administrator privileges to execute.

See [NSISInstallerMode] for more information.

### Internationalization

The NSIS Installer is a multi-language installer, which means you always have a single installer which contains all the selected translations.

You can specify which languages to include using the [`tauri.bundle.windows.nsis.languages`](/reference/config/#languages) property.
A list of languages supported by NSIS is available in [the NSIS GitHub project].
There are a few [Tauri-specific translations] required, so if you see untranslated texts feel free to open a feature request in [Tauri's main repo].
You can also provide [custom translation files](/reference/config/#customlanguagefiles).

By default the operating system default language is used to determine the installer language.
You can also configure the installer to display a language selector before the installer contents are rendered:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "displayLanguageSelector": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Minimum Webview2 version

If your app requires features only available in newer Webview2 versions (such as custom URI schemes), you can instruct the Windows installer
to verify the current Webview2 version and run the Webview2 bootstrapper if it does not match the target version.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "minimumWebview2Version": "110.0.1531.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Capabilities for Different Windows and Platforms

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import ShowSolution from '@components/ShowSolution.astro'
import Cta from '@fragments/cta.mdx';

This guide will help you customize the capabilities of your Tauri app.

## Content of this guide

- Create multiple windows in a Tauri app
- Use different capabilities for different windows
- Use platform-specific capabilities

## Prerequisites

This exercise is meant to be read after completing [`Using Plugin Permissions`](/learn/security/using-plugin-permissions/).

## Guide

<Steps>
1. ### Create Multiple Windows in a Tauri Application

   Here we create an app with two windows labelled `first` and `second`.
   There are multiple ways to create windows in your Tauri application.

   #### Create Windows with the Tauri Configuration File

   In the Tauri configuration file, usually named `tauri.conf.json`:

    <ShowSolution>
    ```javascript
      "productName": "multiwindow",
      ...
      "app": {
        "windows": [
          {
            "label": "first",
            "title": "First",
            "width": 800,
            "height": 600
          },
          {
            "label": "second",
            "title": "Second",
            "width": 800,
            "height": 600
          }
        ],
      },
      ...
    }
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

   #### Create Windows Programmatically

    In the Rust code to create a Tauri app:

    <ShowSolution>
    ```rust
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![greet])
        .setup(|app| {
            let webview_url = tauri::WebviewUrl::App("index.html".into());
            // First window
            tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder::new(app, "first", webview_url.clone())
                .title("First")
                .build()?;
            // Second window
            tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder::new(app, "second", webview_url)
                .title("Second")
                .build()?;
            Ok(())
        })
        .run(context)
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

2. ### Apply Different Capabilities to Different Windows

    The windows of a Tauri app can use different features or plugins of the Tauri backend.
    For better security it is recommended to only give the necessary capabilities to each window.
    We simulate a scenario where the `first` windows uses filesystem and dialog functionalities and `second`
    only needs dialog functionalities.

    #### Separate capability files per category

    It is recommended to separate the capability files per category of actions they enable.

    <ShowSolution>
    JSON files in the `src-tauri/capabilities` will be taken into account for the capability system.
    Here we separate capabilities related to the filesystem and dialog window into `filesystem.json`
    and `dialog.json`.

    *filetree of the Tauri project:*
    ```
    /src
    /src-tauri
      /capabilities
        filesystem.json
        dialog.json
      tauri.conf.json
    package.json
    README.md
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

    #### Give filesystem capabilities to the `first` window

    We give the `first` window the capability to have read access to the content of the `$HOME` directory.

    <ShowSolution>
    Use the `windows` field in a capability file with one or multiple window labels.

    ```json title="filesystem.json"
    {
      "identifier": "fs-read-home",
      "description": "Allow access file access to home directory",
      "local": true,
      "windows": ["first"],
      "permissions": [
        "fs:allow-home-read",
      ]
    }
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

    #### Give dialog capabilities to the `first` and `second` window

    We give to `first` and `second` windows the capability to create a "Yes/No" dialog

    <ShowSolution>
    Use the `windows` field in a capability file with one or multiple window labels.

    ```json title="dialog.json"
    {
      "identifier": "dialog",
      "description": "Allow to open a dialog",
      "local": true,
      "windows": ["first", "second"],
      "permissions": ["dialog:allow-ask"]
    }
    ```

    </ShowSolution>


3. ### Make Capabilities Platform Dependent

    We now want to customize the capabilities to be active only on certain platforms.
    We make our filesystem capabilities only active on `linux` and `windows`.

    <ShowSolution>
    Use the `platforms` field in a capability file to make it platform-specific.

    ```json title="filesystem.json"
    {
      "identifier": "fs-read-home",
      "description": "Allow access file access to home directory",
      "local": true,
      "windows": ["first"],
      "permissions": [
        "fs:allow-home-read",
      ],
      "platforms": ["linux", "windows"]
    }
    ```

    The currently available platforms are `linux`, `windows`, `macos`, `android`, and `ios`.
    </ShowSolution>

</Steps>

## Conclusion and Resources

We have learned how to create multiple windows in a Tauri app and give them specific capabilities. Furthermore these capabilities can also be targeted to certain platforms.

An example application that used window capabilities can be found in the [`api` example](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/examples/api) of the [Tauri Github repository](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri).
The fields that can be used in a capability file are listed in the [Capability](/reference/acl/capability/) reference.

# Using Plugin Permissions

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import ShowSolution from '@components/ShowSolution.astro'
import Cta from '@fragments/cta.mdx';

The goal of this exercise is to get a better understanding on how
plugin permissions can be enabled or disabled, where they are described
and how to use default permissions of plugins.

At the end you will have the ability to find and use permissions of
arbitrary plugins and understand how to custom tailor existing permissions.
You will have an example Tauri application where a plugin and plugin specific
permissions are used.

<Steps>

1. ### Create Tauri Application

    Create your Tauri application.
    In our example we will facilitate [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app):

    <Cta />

    We will proceed in this step-by-step explanation with `pnpm` but you can choose another
    package manager and replace it in the commands accordingly.


    <ShowSolution>
    ```
    pnpm create tauri-app
    ```

    ```
    ✔ Project name · plugin-permission-demo
    ✔ Choose which language to use for your frontend · TypeScript / JavaScript - (pnpm, yarn, npm, bun)
    ✔ Choose your package manager · pnpm
    ✔ Choose your UI template · Vanilla
    ✔ Choose your UI flavor · TypeScript

    Template created! To get started run:
    cd plugin-permission-demo
    pnpm install
    pnpm tauri dev
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

2. ### Add the `file-system` Plugin to Your Application

    To search for existing plugins you can use multiple resources.

    The most straight forward way would be to check out if your plugin is already
    in the [Plugins](/plugin/) section of the documentation and therefore part of Tauri's
    maintained plugin set.
    The Filesystem plugin is part of the Tauri plugin workspace and you can add it to
    your project by following the [instructions](/plugin/file-system/#setup).

    If the plugin is part of the community effort you can most likely find it
    on [crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=tauri-plugin-) when searching for `tauri-plugin-<your plugin name>`.

    <ShowSolution>
    If it is an existing plugin from our workspace you can use the automated way:

    ```
    pnpm tauri add fs
    ```

    If you have found it on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tauri-plugin-fs)
    you need to manually add it as a dependency and modify the Tauri builder
    to initialize the plugin:

    ```sh
    cargo add tauri-plugin-fs
    ```

    Modify `lib.rs` to initialize the plugin:

    ```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs" ins={4}
    #[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
    fn run() {
      tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_fs::init())
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
    }
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

3. ### Understand the Default Permissions of the `fs` Plugin
    
    Each plugin has a `default` permission set, which contains
    all permissions and scopes to use the plugin out of the box
    with a reasonable minimal feature set.
    
    In the case of official maintained plugins you can find a
    rendered description in the documentation
    (eg. [fs default](/plugin/file-system/#default-permission)).

    In case you are figuring this out for a community plugin you
    need to check out the source code of the plugin.
    This should be defined in `your-plugin/permissions/default.toml`.

    <ShowSolution>
    ```
    "$schema" = "schemas/schema.json"

    [default]
    description = """
    # Tauri `fs` default permissions

    This configuration file defines the default permissions granted
    to the filesystem.

    ### Granted Permissions

    This default permission set enables all read-related commands and
    allows access to the `$APP` folder and sub directories created in it.
    The location of the `$APP` folder depends on the operating system,
    where the application is run.

    In general the `$APP` folder needs to be manually created
    by the application at runtime, before accessing files or folders
    in it is possible.

    ### Denied Permissions

    This default permission set prevents access to critical components
    of the Tauri application by default.
    On Windows the webview data folder access is denied.

    """
    permissions = ["read-all", "scope-app-recursive", "deny-default"]

    ```
    </ShowSolution>

  4. ### Find the Right Permissions
      
      This step is all about finding the permissions you need to
      for your commands to be exposed to the frontend with the minimal
      access to your system.

      The `fs` plugin has autogenerated permissions which will disable
      or enable individual commands and allow or disable global scopes.

      These can be found in the [documentation](/plugin/file-system/#permission-table)
      or in the source code of the plugin (`fs/permissions/autogenerated`).

      Let us assume we want to enable writing to a text file `test.txt`
      located in the users `$HOME` folder.

      For this we would search in the autogenerated permissions for a
      permission to enable writing to text files like `allow-write-text-file`
      and then for a scope which would allow us to access the `$HOME/test.txt`
      file.

      We need to add these to our `capabilities` section in our
      `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` or in a file in the `src-tauri/capabilities/` folder.
      By default there is already a capability in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` we 
      can modify.

      <ShowSolution>

      ```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json" del={18} ins={19}
      {
        "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
        "identifier": "default",
        "description": "Capability for the main window",
        "windows": [
          "main"
        ],
        "permissions": [
          "path:default",
          "event:default",
          "window:default",
          "app:default",
          "image:default",
          "resources:default",
          "menu:default",
          "tray:default",
          "shell:allow-open",
          "fs:default",
          "fs:allow-write-text-file",
        ]
      }
      ```

      </ShowSolution>

      Since there are only autogenerated scopes in the `fs` plugin to
      access the full `$HOME` folder, we need to configure our own scope.
      This scope should be only enabled for the `write-text-file` command
      and should only expose our `test.txt` file.

      <ShowSolution>
      ```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json" del={18} ins={19-22}
         {
        "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
        "identifier": "default",
        "description": "Capability for the main window",
        "windows": [
          "main"
        ],
        "permissions": [
          "path:default",
          "event:default",
          "window:default",
          "app:default",
          "image:default",
          "resources:default",
          "menu:default",
          "tray:default",
          "shell:allow-open",
          "fs:allow-write-text-file",
          {
            "identifier": "fs:allow-write-text-file",
            "allow": [{ "path": "$HOME/test.txt" }]
          },
        ]
      }
      ```
      </ShowSolution>
    5. ### Test Permissions in Practice

        After we have added the necessary permission we want to
        confirm that our application can access the file and write
        it's content.

        <ShowSolution>
        We can use this snippet in our application to write to the file:

        ```ts title="src/main.ts"
        import { writeTextFile, BaseDirectory } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-fs';

        let greetInputEl: HTMLInputElement | null;

        async function write(message: string) {
            await writeTextFile('test.txt', message, { baseDir: BaseDirectory.Home });
        }

        window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
          greetInputEl = document.querySelector("#greet-input");
          document.querySelector("#greet-form")?.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            if (!greetInputEl )
              return;

            write(greetInputEl.value == "" ? "No input provided": greetInputEl.value);

          });
        });

        ```

        Replacing the `src/main.ts` with this snippet means we do not need to modify the default `index.html`,
        when using the plain Vanilla+Typescript app.
        Entering any input into the input field of the running app will be
        written to the file on submit.

        Let's test now in practice:

        ```
        pnpm run tauri dev
        ```

        After writing into the input and clicking "Submit",
        we can check via our terminal emulator or by manually opening the
        file in your home folder.

        ```
        cat $HOME/test.txt
        ```

        You should be presented with your input and finished learning about using permissions from plugins in Tauri applications.
        🥳


        If you encountered this error:

        ```sh
        [Error] Unhandled Promise Rejection: fs.write_text_file not allowed. Permissions associated with this command: fs:allow-app-write, fs:allow-app-write-recursive, fs:allow-appcache-write, fs:allow-appcache-write-recursive, fs:allow-appconf...
        (anonymous function) (main.ts:5)
        ```
        Then you very likely did not properly follow the [previous instructions](#find-the-right-permissions).
        </ShowSolution>

 </Steps>

# Writing Plugin Permissions

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import ShowSolution from '@components/ShowSolution.astro'
import Cta from '@fragments/cta.mdx';

The goal of this exercise is to get a better understanding on how
plugin permissions can be created when writing your own plugin.

At the end you will have the ability to create simple permissions for
your plugins.
You will have an example Tauri plugin where permissions are partially autogenerated
and hand crafted.

<Steps>

1. ### Create a Tauri Plugin

    In our example we will facilitate the Tauri [`cli`](/reference/cli/)
    to bootstrap a Tauri plugin source code structure.
    Make sure you have installed all [Prerequisites](/start/prerequisites/)
    and verify you have the Tauri CLI in the correct version
    by running `cargo tauri info`.

    The output should indicate the `tauri-cli` version is `2.x`.
    We will proceed in this step-by-step explanation with `pnpm` but you can choose another
    package manager and replace it in the commands accordingly.

    Once you have a recent version installed you can go
    ahead and create the plugin using the Tauri CLI.

    <ShowSolution>
    ```sh
    mkdir -p tauri-learning
    cd tauri-learning
    cargo tauri plugin new test
    cd tauri-plugin-test
    pnpm install
    pnpm build
    cargo build
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

2. ### Create a New Command

    To showcase something practical and simple let us assume
    our command writes user input to a file in our temporary folder while
    adding some custom header to the file.

    Let's name our command `write_custom_file`, implement it in `src/commands.rs`
    and add it to our plugin builder to be exposed to the frontend.

    Tauri's core utils will autogenerate `allow` and `deny` permissions for this
    command, so we do not need to care about this.

    <ShowSolution>

    The command implementation:

    ```rust title="src/commands.rs" ins={15-22} ins=", Manager"
    use tauri::{AppHandle, command, Runtime};

    use crate::models::*;
    use crate::Result;
    use crate::TestExt;

    #[command]
    pub(crate) async fn ping<R: Runtime>(
        app: AppHandle<R>,
        payload: PingRequest,
    ) -> Result<PingResponse> {
        app.test1().ping(payload)
    }

    #[command]
    pub(crate) async fn write_custom_file<R: Runtime>(
        user_input: String,
        app: AppHandle<R>,
    ) -> Result<String> {
        std::fs::write(app.path().temp_dir().unwrap(), user_input)?;
        Ok("success".to_string())
    }
   
    ```

    Auto-Generate inbuilt permissions for your new command:

    ```rust title="src/build.rs" ins="\"write_custom_file\""
    const COMMANDS: &[&str] = &["ping", "write_custom_file"];
    ```

    These inbuilt permissions will be automatically generated by the Tauri build
    system and will be visible in the `permissions/autogenerated/commands` folder.
    By default an `enable-<command>` and `deny-<command>` permission will
    be created.

    </ShowSolution>
3. ### Expose the New Command

    The previous step was to write the actual command implementation.
    Next we want to expose it to the frontend so it can be consumed.

    <ShowSolution>
 
    Configure the Tauri builder to generate the invoke handler to pass frontend
    IPC requests to the newly implemented command:

    ```rust title="src/lib.rs"  ins="commands::write_custom_file,"
    pub fn init<R: Runtime>() -> TauriPlugin<R> {
    Builder::new("test")
        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
            commands::ping,
            commands::write_custom_file,
        ])
        .setup(|app, api| {
            #[cfg(mobile)]
            let test = mobile::init(app, api)?;
            #[cfg(desktop)]
            let test = desktop::init(app, api)?;
            app.manage(test);

            // manage state so it is accessible by the commands
            app.manage(MyState::default());
            Ok(())
        })
        .build()
    }
    ```

    Expose the new command in the frontend module.

    This step is essential for the example application to successfully
    import the frontend module. This is for convenience and has
    no security impact, as the command handler is already generated
    and the command can be manually invoked from the frontend.

    ```ts title="guest-js/index.ts" ins={11-13}
    import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core'

    export async function ping(value: string): Promise<string | null> {
      return await invoke<{value?: string}>('plugin:test|ping', {
        payload: {
          value,
        },
      }).then((r) => (r.value ? r.value : null));
    }

    export async function writeCustomFile(user_input: string): Promise<string> {
     return await invoke('plugin:test|write_custom_file',{userInput: user_input});
    }
    ```

    :::tip
    The invoke parameter needs to be CamelCase. In this example it is `userInput` instead of `user_input`. 
    :::

    Make sure your package is built:

    ```
    pnpm build
    ```

    </ShowSolution>

4. ### Define Default Plugin Permissions

    As our plugin should expose the `write_custom_file` command by default
    we should add this to our `default.toml` permission.

    <ShowSolution>
    Add this to our default permission set to allow the new command
    we just exposed.

    ```toml title="permissions/default.toml" ins=", \"allow-write-custom-file\""
    "$schema" = "schemas/schema.json"
    [default]
    description = "Default permissions for the plugin"
    permissions = ["allow-ping", "allow-write-custom-file"]
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

5. ### Invoke Test Command from Example Application
    
    The created plugin directory structure contains an `examples/tauri-app` folder,
    which has a ready to use Tauri application to test out the plugin.

    Since we added a new command we need to slightly modify the frontend to
    invoke our new command instead.

    <ShowSolution>
    ```svelte title="src/App.svelte" del={11-13,42-45} ins={14-16,45-49}
    <script>
      import Greet from './lib/Greet.svelte'
      import { ping, writeCustomFile } from 'tauri-plugin-test-api'

      let response = ''

      function updateResponse(returnValue) {
        response += `[${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}]` + (typeof returnValue === 'string' ? returnValue : JSON.stringify(returnValue)) + '<br>'
      }

      function _ping() {
        ping("Pong!").then(updateResponse).catch(updateResponse)
      }
      function _writeCustomFile() {
        writeCustomFile("HELLO FROM TAURI PLUGIN").then(updateResponse).catch(updateResponse)
      }
    </script>

    <main class="container">
      <h1>Welcome to Tauri!</h1>

      <div class="row">
        <a href="https://vitejs.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src="/vite.svg" class="logo vite" alt="Vite Logo" />
        </a>
        <a href="https://tauri.app" target="_blank">
          <img src="/tauri.svg" class="logo tauri" alt="Tauri Logo" />
        </a>
        <a href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src="/svelte.svg" class="logo svelte" alt="Svelte Logo" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>

      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <Greet />
      </div>

      <div>
        <button on:click="{_ping}">Ping</button>
        <div>{@html response}</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button on:click="{_writeCustomFile}">Write</button>
        <div>{@html response}</div>
      </div>


    </main>

    <style>
      .logo.vite:hover {
        filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2em #747bff);
      }

      .logo.svelte:hover {
        filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2em #ff3e00);
      }
    </style>
    ```

    Running this and pressing the "Write" button you should be greeted with this:

    ```
    success
    ```

    And you should find a `test.txt` file in your temporary folder containing a message
    from our new implemented plugin command. 
    🥳

# Node.js as a sidecar

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';
import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CTA from '@fragments/cta.mdx';

In this guide we are going to package a Node.js application to a self contained binary
to be used as a sidecar in a Tauri application without requiring the end user to have a Node.js installation.
This example tutorial is applicable for desktop operating systems only.

We recommend reading the general [sidecar guide] first for a deeper understanding of how Tauri sidecars work.

In this example we will create a Node.js application that reads input from the command line [process.argv]
and writes output to stdout using [console.log]. <br/>
You can leverage alternative inter-process communication systems such as a localhost server, stdin/stdout or local sockets.
Note that each has their own advantages, drawbacks and security concerns.

## Prerequisites

An existing Tauri application set up with the shell plugin, that compiles and runs for you locally.

:::tip[Create a lab app]

If you are not an advanced user it's **highly recommended** that you use the options and frameworks provided here. It's just a lab, you can delete the project when you're done.

<CTA />

- Project name: `node-sidecar-lab`
- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `Typescript / Javascript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `Typescript`
- Would you like to setup the project for mobile as well? `yes`

:::

:::note
Please follow the [shell plugin guide](/plugin/shell/) first to set up and initialize the plugin correctly.
Without the plugin being initialized and configured the example won't work.
:::

## Guide

<Steps>

1.  ##### Initialize Sidecar Project

    Let's create a new Node.js project to contain our sidecar implementation.
    Create a new directory **in your Tauri application root folder** (in this example we will call it `sidecar-app`)
    and run the `init` command of your preferred Node.js package manager inside the directory:

    <CommandTabs npm="npm init" yarn="yarn init" pnpm="pnpm init" />

    We will compile our Node.js application to a self container binary using [pkg].
    Let's install it as a development dependency:

    <CommandTabs
      npm="npm add @yao-pkg/pkg --save-dev"
      yarn="yarn add @yao-pkg/pkg --dev"
      pnpm="pnpm add @yao-pkg/pkg --save-dev"
    />

1.  ##### Write Sidecar Logic

    Now we can start writing JavaScript code that will be executed by our Tauri application.

    In this example we will process a command from the command line argmuents and write output to stdout,
    which means our process will be short lived and only handle a single command at a time.
    If your application must be long lived, consider using alternative inter-process communication systems.

    Let's create a `index.js` file in our `sidecar-app` directory and write a basic Node.js app:

    ```js title=sidecar-app/index.js
    const command = process.argv[2];

    switch (command) {
      case 'ping':
        const message = process.argv[3];
        console.log(`pong, ${message}`);
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`unknown command ${command}`);
        process.exit(1);
    }
    ```

1.  ##### Package the Sidecar

    To package our Node.js application to a self contained binary, we can run the following `pkg` command:

    <CommandTabs
      npm="npm run pkg -- --output app"
      yarn="yarn pkg --output app"
      pnpm="pnpm pkg --output app"
    />

    This will create the `sidecar-app/app` binary on Linux and macOS, and a `sidecar-app/app.exe` executable on Windows.
    To rename this file to the expected Tauri sidecar filename, we can use the following Node.js script:

    ```js
    import { execSync } from 'child_process';
    import fs from 'fs';

    const ext = process.platform === 'win32' ? '.exe' : '';

    const rustInfo = execSync('rustc -vV');
    const targetTriple = /host: (\S+)/g.exec(rustInfo)[1];
    if (!targetTriple) {
      console.error('Failed to determine platform target triple');
    }
    fs.renameSync(
      `app${ext}`,
      `../src-tauri/binaries/app-${targetTriple}${ext}`
    );
    ```

1.  ##### Configure the Sidecar in the Tauri Application

    Now that we have our Node.js application ready, we can connect it to our Tauri application
    by configuring the [`bundle > externalBin`] array:

    ```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
    {
      "bundle": {
        "externalBin": ["binaries/app"]
      }
    }
    ```

    The Tauri CLI will handle the bundling of the sidecar binary as long as it exists as `src-tauri/binaries/app-<target-triple>`.

1.  ##### Execute the Sidecar

    We can run the sidecar binary either from Rust code or directly from JavaScript.

    <Tabs syncKey="lang">

      <TabItem label="JavaScript">

        Let's execute the `ping` command in the Node.js sidecar directly:

        ```javascript
        import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-shell';

        const message = 'Tauri';

        const command = Command.sidecar('binaries/app', ['ping', message]);
        const output = await command.execute();
        const response = output.stdout;
        ```

      </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Rust">

        Let's pipe a `ping` Tauri command to the Node.js sidecar:

        ```rust
        #[tauri::command]
        async fn ping(app: tauri::AppHandle, message: String) -> String {
          let sidecar_command = app
            .shell()
            .sidecar("app")
            .unwrap()
            .arg("ping")
            .arg(message);
          let output = sidecar_command.output().unwrap();
          let response = String::from_utf8(output.stdout).unwrap();
          response
        }
        ```

      </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

In this lab we'll be implementing a basic splashscreen functionality in a Tauri app. Doing so
is quite straight forward, a splashscreen is effectively just a matter of creating a new window
that displays some contents during the period your app is doing some heavy setup related tasks
and then closing it when setting up is done.

## Prerequisites

:::tip[Create a lab app]

If you are not an advanced user it's **highly recommended** that you use the options and frameworks provided here. It's just a lab, you can delete the project when you're done.

<CTA/>

- Project name: `splashscreen-lab`
- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `Typescript / Javascript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `Typescript`
- Would you like to setup the project for mobile as well? `yes`
:::

## Steps

<Steps>

1. ##### Install dependencies and run the project

   Before you start developing any project it's important to build and run the initial template, just to validate your setup is working as intended.

    <ShowSolution>
    ```sh frame=none
    # Make sure you're in the right directory
    cd splashscreen-lab
    # Install dependencies
    pnpm install
    # Build and run the app
    pnpm tauri dev
    ```
    <Image src={step_1} alt="Successful run of the created template app."/>
    </ShowSolution>

1. ##### Register new windows in `tauri.conf.json`

   The easiest way of adding new windows is by adding them directly to `tauri.conf.json`. You can also create them dynamically at startup,
   but for the sake of simplicity lets just register them instead. Make sure you have a window with the label `main` that's being created as a hidden window and a window with the label `splashscreen` that's created as being shown directly. You can leave all other options as their defaults, or tweak them based on preference.

    <ShowSolution>
    ```json
    // src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
    {
        "windows": [
            {
                "label": "main",
                "visible": false
            },
            {
                "label": "splashscreen",
                "url": "/splashscreen"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

1. ##### Create a new page to host your splashscreen

   Before you begin you'll need to have some content to show. How you develop new pages depend on your chosen framework,
   most have the concept of a "router" that handles page navigation which should work just like normal in Tauri, in which case
   you just create a new splashscreen page. Or as we're going to be doing here, create a new `splashscreen.html` file to host the contents.

   What's important here is that you can navigate to a `/splashscreen` URL and be shown the contents you want for your splashscreen. Try running the app again after this step!

    <ShowSolution>
    ```html
    // /splashscreen.html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/styles.css" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Tauri App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Tauri used Splash!</h1>
            <div class="row">
                <h5>It was super effective!</h5>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    <Image src={step_3} alt="The splashscreen we just created."/>
    </ShowSolution>

1. ##### Start some setup tasks

    Since splashscreens are generally intended to be used for the sake of hiding heavy setup related tasks, lets fake giving the app something heavy to do, some in the frontend and some in the backend.

    To fake heavy setup in the frontend we're going to be using a simple `setTimeout` function.
    
    The easiest way to fake heavy operations in the backend is by using the Tokio crate, which is the Rust crate that Tauri uses in the backend to provide an asynchronous runtime. While Tauri provides the runtime there are various utilities that Tauri doesn't re-export from it, so we'll need to add the crate to our project in order to access them. This is a perfectly normal practice within the Rust ecosystem.

    Don't use `std::thread::sleep` in async functions, they run cooperatively in a concurrent environment not in parallel, meaning that if you sleep the thread instead of the Tokio task you'll be locking all tasks scheduled to run on that thread from being executed, causing your app to freeze.

    <ShowSolution>
    ```sh frame=none
    # Run this command where the `Cargo.toml` file is
    cd src-tauri
    # Add the Tokio crate
    cargo add tokio
    # Optionally go back to the top folder to keep developing
    # `tauri dev` can figure out where to run automatically
    cd ..
    ```

    ```javascript
    // src/main.ts
    // These contents can be copy-pasted below the existing code, don't replace the entire file!!

    // Utility function to implement a sleep function in TypeScript
    function sleep(seconds: number): Promise<void> {
        return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000));
    }

    // Setup function
    async function setup() {
        // Fake perform some really heavy setup task
        console.log('Performing really heavy frontend setup task...')
        await sleep(3);
        console.log('Frontend setup task complete!')
        // Set the frontend task as being completed
        invoke('set_complete', {task: 'frontend'})
    }

    // Effectively a JavaScript main function
    window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        setup()
    });
    ```

    ```rust
    // /src-tauri/src/lib.rs
    // Import functionalities we'll be using
    use std::sync::Mutex;
    use tauri::async_runtime::spawn;
    use tauri::{AppHandle, Manager, State};
    use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

    // Create a struct we'll use to track the completion of
    // setup related tasks
    struct SetupState {
        frontend_task: bool,
        backend_task: bool,
    }

    // Our main entrypoint in a version 2 mobile compatible app
    #[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
    pub fn run() {
        // Don't write code before Tauri starts, write it in the
        // setup hook instead!
        tauri::Builder::default()
            // Register a `State` to be managed by Tauri
            // We need write access to it so we wrap it in a `Mutex`
            .manage(Mutex::new(SetupState {
                frontend_task: false,
                backend_task: false,
            }))
            // Add a command we can use to check
            .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![greet, set_complete])
            // Use the setup hook to execute setup related tasks
            // Runs before the main loop, so no windows are yet created
            .setup(|app| {
                // Spawn setup as a non-blocking task so the windows can be
                // created and ran while it executes
                spawn(setup(app.handle().clone()));
                // The hook expects an Ok result
                Ok(())
            })
            // Run the app
            .run(tauri::generate_context!())
            .expect("error while running tauri application");
    }

    #[tauri::command]
    fn greet(name: String) -> String {
        format!("Hello {name} from Rust!")
    }

    // A custom task for setting the state of a setup task
    #[tauri::command]
    async fn set_complete(
        app: AppHandle,
        state: State<'_, Mutex<SetupState>>,
        task: String,
    ) -> Result<(), ()> {
        // Lock the state without write access
        let mut state_lock = state.lock().unwrap();
        match task.as_str() {
            "frontend" => state_lock.frontend_task = true,
            "backend" => state_lock.backend_task = true,
            _ => panic!("invalid task completed!"),
        }
        // Check if both tasks are completed
        if state_lock.backend_task && state_lock.frontend_task {
            // Setup is complete, we can close the splashscreen
            // and unhide the main window!
            let splash_window = app.get_webview_window("splashscreen").unwrap();
            let main_window = app.get_webview_window("main").unwrap();
            splash_window.close().unwrap();
            main_window.show().unwrap();
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    // An async function that does some heavy setup task
    async fn setup(app: AppHandle) -> Result<(), ()> {
        // Fake performing some heavy action for 3 seconds
        println!("Performing really heavy backend setup task...");
        sleep(Duration::from_secs(3)).await;
        println!("Backend setup task completed!");
        // Set the backend task as being completed
        // Commands can be ran as regular functions as long as you take
        // care of the input arguments yourself
        set_complete(
            app.clone(),
            app.state::<Mutex<SetupState>>(),
            "backend".to_string(),
        )
        .await?;
        Ok(())
    }
    ```
    </ShowSolution>

1. ##### Run the application

   You should now see a splashscreen window pop up, both the frontend and backend will perform their respective heavy 3 second setup tasks, after which the splashscreen disappears and the main window is shown!

</Steps>

## Discuss

##### Should you have a splashscreen?

In general having a splashscreen is an admittance of defeat that you couldn't make your
app load fast enough to not need one. In fact it tends to be better to just go straight
to a main window that then shows some little spinner somewhere in a corner informing the
user there's still setup tasks happening in the background.

However, with that said, it can be a stylistic choice that you want to have a splashscreen,
or you might have some very particular requirement that makes it impossible to start the
app until some tasks are performed. It's definitely not *wrong* to have a splashscreen, it
just tends to not be necessary and can make users feel like the app isn't very well optimized.

# System Tray

import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tauri allows you to create and customize a system tray for your application.
This can enhance the user experience by providing quick access to common actions.

## Configuration

First of all, update your `Cargo.toml` to include the necessary feature for the system tray.

```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml"
tauri = { version = "2.0.0", features = [ "tray-icon" ] }
```

## Usage

The tray API is available in both JavaScript and Rust.

### Create a Tray Icon

<Tabs synckey="language">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
Use the [`TrayIcon.new`] static function to create a new tray icon:

```javascript
import { TrayIcon } from '@tauri-apps/api/tray';

const options = {
  // here you can add a tray menu, title, tooltip, event handler, etc
};

const tray = await TrayIcon.new(options);
```

See [`TrayIconOptions`] for more information on the customization options.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
use tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder;

tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
        let tray = TrayIconBuilder::new().build(app)?;
        Ok(())
    })

```

See [`TrayIconBuilder`] for more information on customization options.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Change the Tray Icon

When creating the tray you can use the application icon as the tray icon:

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { TrayIcon } from '@tauri-apps/api/tray';
import { defaultWindowIcon } from '@tauri-apps/api/app';

const options = {
  icon: await defaultWindowIcon(),
};

const tray = await TrayIcon.new(options);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
let tray = TrayIconBuilder::new()
  .icon(app.default_window_icon().unwrap().clone())
  .build(app)?;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add a Menu

To attach a menu that is displayed when the tray is clicked, you can use the `menu` option.

:::note
By default the menu is displayed on both left and right clicks.

To prevent the menu from popping up on left click, call the [`menu_on_left_click(false)`][TrayIconBuilder::menu_on_left_click] Rust function
or set the [`menuOnLeftClick`] JavaScript option to `false`.
:::

{/* TODO: link to the menu plugin documentation page */}

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { TrayIcon } from '@tauri-apps/api/tray';
import { Menu } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

const menu = await Menu.new({
  items: [
    {
      id: 'quit',
      text: 'Quit',
    },
  ],
});

const options = {
  menu,
  menuOnLeftClick: true,
};

const tray = await TrayIcon.new(options);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
use tauri::{
  menu::{Menu, MenuItem},
  tray::TrayIconBuilder,
};

let quit_i = MenuItem::with_id(app, "quit", "Quit", true, None::<&str>)?;
let menu = Menu::with_items(app, &[&quit_i])?;

let tray = TrayIconBuilder::new()
  .menu(&menu)
  .menu_on_left_click(true)
  .build(app)?;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Listen to Menu Events

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
On JavaScript you can attach a menu click event listener directly to the menu item:

- Using a shared menu click handler

  ```javascript
  import { Menu } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

  function onTrayMenuClick(itemId) {
    // itemId === 'quit'
  }

  const menu = await Menu.new({
    items: [
      {
        id: 'quit',
        text: 'Quit',
        action: onTrayMenuClick,
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

- Using a dedicated menu click handler

  ```javascript
  import { Menu } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

  const menu = await Menu.new({
    items: [
      {
        id: 'quit',
        text: 'Quit',
        action: () => {
          console.log('quit pressed');
        },
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">
Use the [`TrayIconBuilder::on_menu_event`] method to attach a tray menu click event listener:

```rust
use tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder;

TrayIconBuilder::new()
  .on_menu_event(|app, event| match event.id.as_ref() {
    "quit" => {
      println!("quit menu item was clicked");
      app.exit(0);
    }
    _ => {
      println!("menu item {:?} not handled", event.id);
    }
  })
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Listen to Tray Events

The tray icon emits events for the following mouse events:

- click: triggered when the cursor receives a single left, right or middle click, including information on whether the mouse press was released or not
- Double click: triggered when the cursor receives a double left, right or middle click
- Enter: triggered when the cursor enters the tray icon area
- Move: triggered when the cursor moves around the tray icon area
- Leave: triggered when the cursor leaves the tray icon area

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { TrayIcon } from '@tauri-apps/api/tray';

const options = {
  action: (event) => {
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'Click':
        console.log(
          `mouse ${event.button} button pressed, state: ${event.buttonState}`
        );
        break;
      case 'DoubleClick':
        console.log(`mouse ${event.button} button pressed`);
        break;
      case 'Enter':
        console.log(
          `mouse hovered tray at ${event.rect.position.x}, ${event.rect.position.y}`
        );
        break;
      case 'Move':
        console.log(
          `mouse moved on tray at ${event.rect.position.x}, ${event.rect.position.y}`
        );
        break;
      case 'Leave':
        console.log(
          `mouse left tray at ${event.rect.position.x}, ${event.rect.position.y}`
        );
        break;
    }
  },
};

const tray = await TrayIcon.new(options);
```

See [`TrayIconEvent`][js TrayIconEvent] for more information on the event payload.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
use tauri::{
    Manager,
    tray::{MouseButton, MouseButtonState, TrayIconBuilder, TrayIconEvent}
};

TrayIconBuilder::new()
  .on_tray_icon_event(|tray, event| match event {
    TrayIconEvent::Click {
      button: MouseButton::Left,
      button_state: MouseButtonState::Up,
      ..
    } => {
      println!("left click pressed and released");
      // in this example, let's show and focus the main window when the tray is clicked
      let app = tray.app_handle();
      if let Some(window) = app.get_webview_window("main") {
        let _ = window.show();
        let _ = window.set_focus();
      }
    }

# Window Customization

import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tauri provides lots of options for customizing the look and feel of your app's window. You can create custom titlebars, have transparent windows, enforce size constraints, and more.

## Configuration

There are three ways to change the window configuration:

- <Icon name="external" class="inline-icon" /> [Through
  tauri.conf.json](/reference/config/#windowconfig)
- <Icon name="external" class="inline-icon" /> [Through the JavaScript
  API](/reference/javascript/api/namespacewindow/#window)
- <Icon name="external" class="inline-icon" /> [Through the Window in
  Rust](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0/tauri/window/struct.Window.html)

## Usage

- [Creating a Custom Titlebar](#creating-a-custom-titlebar)
- [(macOS) Transparent Titlebar with Custom Window Background Color](#macos-transparent-titlebar-with-custom-window-background-color)

### Creating a Custom Titlebar

A common use of these window features is creating a custom titlebar. This short tutorial will guide you through that process.

:::note
For macOS, using a custom titlebar will also lose some features provided by the system, such as [moving or aligning the window](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/work-with-app-windows-mchlp2469/mac). Another approach to customizing the titlebar but keeping native functions could be making the titlebar transparent and setting the window background color. See the usage [(macOS) Transparent Titlebar with Custom Window Background Color](#macos-transparent-titlebar-with-custom-window-background-color).
:::

#### tauri.conf.json

Set `decorations` to `false` in your `tauri.conf.json`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" {4}
"tauri": {
	"windows": [
		{
			"decorations": false
		}
	]
}
```

#### Permissions

Add window permissions in capability file.

By default, all plugin commands are blocked and cannot be accessed. You must define a list of permissions in your `capabilities` configuration.

See the [Capabilities Overview](/security/capabilities/) for more information and the [step by step guide](/learn/security/using-plugin-permissions/) to use plugin permissions.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json" ins={6}
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "main-capability",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": ["core:window:default", "core:window:allow-start-dragging"]
}
```

| Permission                                   | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core:window:default`                        | Default permissions for the plugin. Except `window:allow-start-dragging`.      |
| `core:window:allow-close`                    | Enables the close command without any pre-configured scope.                    |
| `core:window:allow-minimize`                 | Enables the minimize command without any pre-configured scope.                 |
| `core:window:allow-start-dragging`           | Enables the start_dragging command without any pre-configured scope.           |
| `core:window:allow-toggle-maximize`          | Enables the toggle_maximize command without any pre-configured scope.          |
| `core:window:allow-internal-toggle-maximize` | Enables the internal_toggle_maximize command without any pre-configured scope. |

#### CSS

Add this CSS sample to keep it at the top of the screen and style the buttons:

```css
.titlebar {
  height: 30px;
  background: #329ea3;
  user-select: none;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto max-content;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
}
.titlebar > .controls {
  display: flex;
}
.titlebar button {
  appearance: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  border: none;
  display: inline-flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: 30px;
  background-color: transparent;
}
.titlebar button:hover {
  background: #5bbec3;
}
```

#### HTML

Put this at the top of your `<body>` tag:

```html
<div class="titlebar">
  <div data-tauri-drag-region></div>
  <div class="controls">
    <button id="titlebar-minimize" title="minimize">
      <!-- https://api.iconify.design/mdi:window-minimize.svg -->
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path fill="currentColor" d="M19 13H5v-2h14z" /><path>
      </svg>
    </button>
    <button id="titlebar-maximize" title="maximize">
      <!-- https://api.iconify.design/mdi:window-maximize.svg -->
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path fill="currentColor" d="M4 4h16v16H4zm2 4v10h12V8z" />

    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

Note that you may need to move the rest of your content down so that the titlebar doesn't cover it.

:::tip

On Windows, if you just want a title bar that doesn't need custom interactions, you can use

```css
*[data-tauri-drag-region] {
  app-region: drag;
}
```

to make the title bar work with touch and pen inputs

:::

#### JavaScript

Use this code snippet to make the buttons work:

```javascript
import { getCurrentWindow } from '@tauri-apps/api/window';

// when using `"withGlobalTauri": true`, you may use
// const { getCurrentWindow } = window.__TAURI__.window;

const appWindow = getCurrentWindow();

document
  .getElementById('titlebar-minimize')
  ?.addEventListener('click', () => appWindow.minimize());
document
  .getElementById('titlebar-maximize')
  ?.addEventListener('click', () => appWindow.toggleMaximize());
document
  .getElementById('titlebar-close')
  ?.addEventListener('click', () => appWindow.close());
```

Note that if you are using a Rust-based frontend, you can copy the code above into a `<script>` element in your `index.html` file.

:::note
`data-tauri-drag-region` will only work on the element to which it is directly applied. If you want the drag behavior to apply to child elements as well, you'll need to add it to each child individually.

This behavior is preserved so that interactive elements like buttons and inputs can function properly.
:::

### Manual Implementation of `data-tauri-drag-region`

For use cases where you customize the drag behavior, you can manually add an event listener with `window.startDragging` instead of using `data-tauri-drag-region`.

#### HTML

From the code in the previous section, we remove `data-tauri-drag-region` and add an `id`:

```html del={1} ins={2}
<div data-tauri-drag-region class="titlebar">
  <div id="titlebar" class="titlebar">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Javascript

Add an event listener to the titlebar element:

```js {2-9}
// ...
document.getElementById('titlebar')?.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  if (e.buttons === 1) {
    // Primary (left) button
    e.detail === 2
      ? appWindow.toggleMaximize() // Maximize on double click
      : appWindow.startDragging(); // Else start dragging
  }
});
```

### (macOS) Transparent Titlebar with Custom Window Background Color

We are going to create the main window and change its background color from the Rust side.

Remove the main window from the `tauri.conf.json` file:

    ```json title="tauri.conf.json" del={3-7}
    "tauri": {
    	"windows": [
    		{
    			"title": "Transparent Titlebar Window",
    			"width": 800,
    			"height": 600
    		}
    	],
    }
    ```

Add `cocoa` crate to dependencies so that we can use it to call the macOS native API:

    ```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml"
    [target."cfg(target_os = \"macos\")".dependencies]
    cocoa = "0.26"
    ```

Create the main window and change its background color:

    ```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
    use tauri::{TitleBarStyle, WebviewUrl, WebviewWindowBuilder};

    pub fn run() {
    	tauri::Builder::default()
    		.setup(|app| {
    			let win_builder =
    				WebviewWindowBuilder::new(app, "main", WebviewUrl::default())
    					.title("Transparent Titlebar Window")
    					.inner_size(800.0, 600.0);

    			// set transparent title bar only when building for macOS
    			#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
    			let win_builder = win_builder.title_bar_style(TitleBarStyle::Transparent);

    			let window = win_builder.build().unwrap();

    			// set background color only when building for macOS
    			#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
    			{
    				use cocoa::appkit::{NSColor, NSWindow};
    				use cocoa::base::{id, nil};

    				let ns_window = window.ns_window().unwrap() as id;
    				unsafe {
    					let bg_color = NSColor::colorWithRed_green_blue_alpha_(
    							nil,
    							50.0 / 255.0,
    							158.0 / 255.0,
    							163.5 / 255.0,
    							1.0,
    					);
    					ns_window.setBackgroundColor_(bg_color);
    				}
    			}

    			Ok(())
    		})
    		.run(tauri::generate_context!())
    		.expect("error while running tauri application");
    }
    ```

# Window Menu

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Native application menus can be attached to both to a window or system tray. Available on desktop.

## Creating a base-level menu

To create a base-level native window menu, and attach to a window:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

Use the [`Menu.new`] static function to create a window menu:

```javascript
import { Menu } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

const menu = await Menu.new({
  items: [
    {
      id: 'quit',
      text: 'Quit',
      action: () => {
        console.log('quit pressed');
      },
    },
  ],
});

// If a window was not created with an explicit menu or had one set explicitly,
// this menu will be assigned to it.
menu.setAsAppMenu().then((res) => {
  console.log('menu set success', res);
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]
use tauri::menu::{MenuBuilder};

fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
        .setup(|app| {
            let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app)
                .text("open", "Open")
                .text("close", "Close")
                .build()?;

            app.set_menu(menu)?;

            Ok(())
        })
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Listening to events on custom menu items

Each custom menu item triggers an event when clicked. Use the `on_menu_event` API to handle them.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { Menu } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

const menu = await Menu.new({
  items: [
    {
      id: 'Open',
      text: 'open',
      action: () => {
        console.log('open pressed');
      },
    },
    {
      id: 'Close',
      text: 'close',
      action: () => {
        console.log('close pressed');
      },
    },
  ],
});

await menu.setAsAppMenu();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]
use tauri::menu::{MenuBuilder};

fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
        .setup(|app| {
            let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app)
                .text("open", "Open")
                .text("close", "Close")
                .build()?;

            app.set_menu(menu)?;

            app.on_menu_event(move |app_handle: &tauri::AppHandle, event| {

                println!("menu event: {:?}", event.id());

                match event.id().0.as_str() {
                    "open" => {
                        println!("open event");
                    }
                    "close" => {
                        println!("close event");
                    }
                    _ => {
                        println!("unexpected menu event");
                    }
                }
            });

            Ok(())
        })
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating a multi-level menu

To create a multi-level menu, you can add some submenus to the menu item:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { Menu, MenuItem, Submenu } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

const fileSubmenu = await Submenu.new({
  text: 'File',
  items: [
    await MenuItem.new({
      id: 'new',
      text: 'New',
      action: () => {
        console.log('New clicked');
      },
    }),
    await MenuItem.new({
      id: 'open',
      text: 'Open',
      action: () => {
        console.log('Open clicked');
      },
    }),
    await MenuItem.new({
      id: 'save_as',
      text: 'Save As...',
      action: () => {
        console.log('Save As clicked');
      },
    }),
  ],
});

const editSubmenu = await Submenu.new({
  text: 'Edit',
  items: [
    await MenuItem.new({
      id: 'undo',
      text: 'Undo',
      action: () => {
        console.log('Undo clicked');
      },
    }),
    await MenuItem.new({
      id: 'redo',
      text: 'Redo',
      action: () => {
        console.log('Redo clicked');
      },
    }),
  ],
});

const menu = await Menu.new({
  items: [
    fileSubmenu,
    editSubmenu,
    await MenuItem.new({
      id: 'quit',
      text: 'Quit',
      action: () => {
        console.log('Quit pressed');
      },
    }),
  ],
});

menu.setAsAppMenu();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
use tauri::menu::{CheckMenuItemBuilder, MenuBuilder, SubmenuBuilder};

fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
        .setup(|app| {
            let file_menu = SubmenuBuilder::new(app, "File")
                .text("open", "Open")
                .text("quit", "Quit")
                .build()?;

            let lang_str = "en";
            let check_sub_item_1 = CheckMenuItemBuilder::new("English")
                .id("en")
                .checked(lang_str == "en")
                .build(app)?;

            let check_sub_item_2 = CheckMenuItemBuilder::new("Chinese")

                .icon(icon_image)
                .build(app)?;

            let other_item = SubmenuBuilder::new(app, "language")
                .item(&check_sub_item_1)
                .item(&check_sub_item_2)
                .build()?;

            let menu = MenuBuilder::new(app)
                .items(&[&file_menu, &other_item,&icon_item])
                .build()?;

            app.set_menu(menu)?;

            Ok(())
        })
}
```

Note that you need to enable `image-ico` or `image-png` feature to use this API:

```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "...", features = ["...", "image-png"] }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating predefined menu

To use built-in (native) menu items that has predefined behavior by the operating system or Tauri:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { Menu, PredefinedMenuItem } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

const copy = await PredefinedMenuItem.new({
  text: 'copy-text',
  item: 'Copy',

const separator = await PredefinedMenuItem.new({
  text: 'separator-text',
  item: 'Separator',

const menu = await Menu.new({
  items: [copy, separator, undo, redo, cut, paste, select_all],
});

await menu.setAsAppMenu();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]

            app.set_menu(menu)?;

            Ok(())
        })
}
```

For more preset capabilities, please refer to the documentation [`PredefinedMenuItem`].

:::tip
The menu builder has dedicated methods to add each predefined menu item so you can call `.copy()` instead of `.item(&PredefinedMenuItem::copy(app, None)?)`.
